## 💡 Study Tips

### Active Learning:
- **Type, don't copy:** Write every code example yourself
- **Experiment:** Change values and see what happens
- **Break things:** Intentionally create errors to understand them
- **Explain out loud:** Teach concepts to yourself or others

### When Stuck:
1. Read error messages carefully
2. Check syntax (semicolons, brackets, etc.)
3. Use print statements to debug
4. Search for the error message online
5. Ask for help in forums or communities

### Time Management:
- Study in focused 25-minute blocks (Pomodoro)
- Take 5-minute breaks
- Don't study when tired
- Review previous day's material before starting new topics
