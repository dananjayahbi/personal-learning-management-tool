# Chapter 4: Problem Solving Strategies

## 🎯 Chapter Overview

Welcome to Chapter 4! This chapter is about developing a **systematic approach to problem-solving**. Many people struggle with DSA not because they lack knowledge, but because they don't have a structured method to approach problems.

**Duration:** 3-4 days  
**Difficulty:** Beginner  
**Prerequisites:** Chapters 1-3 completed

## 🧠 Why This Chapter Matters

> "Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe." - Abraham Lincoln

Most beginners jump straight into coding without understanding the problem. This leads to:
- ❌ Wrong solutions
- ❌ Inefficient code
- ❌ Wasted time debugging
- ❌ Frustration and burnout

This chapter teaches you to **think before you code**, which will:
- ✅ Save hours of debugging time
- ✅ Lead to cleaner, more efficient solutions
- ✅ Build confidence in interviews
- ✅ Make you a better problem solver overall
