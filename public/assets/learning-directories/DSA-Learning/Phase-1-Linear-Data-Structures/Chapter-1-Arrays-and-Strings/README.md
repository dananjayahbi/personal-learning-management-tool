## 🔑 Key Takeaways

### Time Complexities to Remember:
- **Array Access:** O(1)
- **Array Search:** O(n) unsorted, O(log n) sorted (binary search)
- **Array Insertion/Deletion:** O(n) worst case
- **Two-Pointer:** Usually O(n)
- **Sliding Window:** O(n) or O(n*k) depending on window operations
- **Kadane's Algorithm:** O(n)

### Space Complexities:
- **In-place algorithms:** O(1) extra space
- **Hash map for frequency:** O(n) space
- **Dynamic array amortized:** O(1) for append

### Common Pitfalls:
- ⚠️ Off-by-one errors in loops
- ⚠️ Not handling edge cases (empty array, single element)
- ⚠️ Integer overflow in sum calculations
- ⚠️ Modifying array while iterating
- ⚠️ Forgetting string immutability in some languages

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Master the Basics First:** Don't rush to advanced problems. Build a solid foundation.
2. **Draw It Out:** Visualize arrays and pointers on paper before coding.
3. **Think Before Coding:** Spend 5-10 minutes understanding the problem.
4. **Test Edge Cases:** Empty array, single element, all same elements, etc.
5. **Optimize Later:** Get a working solution first, then optimize.
6. **Learn Multiple Approaches:** Same problem can be solved many ways.
7. **Time Yourself:** Practice with time constraints for interview prep.
8. **Review Solutions:** Even if you solve it, check other approaches.
