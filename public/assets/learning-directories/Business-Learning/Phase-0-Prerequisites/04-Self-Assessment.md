# Self-Assessment: Are You Ready to Be a Founder?

## Introduction

Entrepreneurship isn't for everyone, and that's okay. This chapter helps you honestly evaluate your readiness to start and lead CoodLoom. Self-awareness is one of the most valuable traits a founder can have.

**Important**: This isn't about discouraging you—it's about identifying areas to develop and ensuring you go in with eyes wide open.

## Part 1: Personal Readiness Assessment

### Motivation & Commitment

#### Question 1: Why Do You Want to Start CoodLoom?

Rate your agreement (1 = Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree):

- [ ] I want to solve a real problem I've observed (__/5)
- [ ] I want financial independence and wealth (__/5)
- [ ] I want to be my own boss (__/5)
- [ ] I want to build something meaningful (__/5)

**Reflection Questions**:
1. What are your top 3 motivations?

3. Which motivations will sustain you through difficult times?

**Red Flags**:
- ⚠️ Primary motivation is status/title
