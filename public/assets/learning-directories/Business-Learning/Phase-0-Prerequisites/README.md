## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Rushing through without doing exercises** - Knowledge without application is useless
❌ **Skipping self-assessment** - Self-awareness is critical for founders
❌ **Not involving co-founder** - Alignment is essential from day one
❌ **Treating this as just reading** - This is active learning, not passive
❌ **Avoiding uncomfortable truths** - Honest assessment saves time and pain later
❌ **Setting vague goals** - "Grow CoodLoom" is not a goal; "$10K MRR by Q2" is
❌ **Not tracking metrics** - What gets measured gets managed
❌ **Skipping resources** - Templates save time and provide structure
