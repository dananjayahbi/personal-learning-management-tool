## Product Development Principles

### 1. **Customer-Driven, Not Feature-Driven**

❌ Don't: "Let's build AI because it's cool"
✅ Do: "Customers struggle with forecasting, let's use AI to help"

### 2. **Ship Fast, Iterate Faster**

❌ Don't: Wait 6 months for "perfect" feature
✅ Do: Ship MVP in 2 weeks, improve based on feedback

### 3. **Reliability Over Innovation**

❌ Don't: Break core features to add new ones
✅ Do: Maintain 99.9% uptime, innovate carefully

### 4. **Simple Over Complex**

❌ Don't: 50 features that confuse users
✅ Do: 10 features that work flawlessly

### 5. **Build for Today, Architect for Tomorrow**

❌ Don't: Over-engineer for scale you don't have
✅ Do: Build for current needs, but with scalable foundation
