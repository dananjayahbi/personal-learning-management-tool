#### 4. Demo Script

**Demo Structure** (30-45 minutes):

**1. Opening (5 min)**
```
"Thanks for joining! Before I jump in, I want to make sure we focus on what's most important to you. You mentioned [pain point from discovery]. Is that still the main concern?"

[Let them talk - don't skip this!]

"Perfect. I'll show you exactly how we solve that, and we'll have time for questions throughout."
```

**2. Context Setting (2 min)**
```
"Quick context: CoodLoom helps [target customer] solve [problem] by [solution approach]. We've helped companies like [similar customer] achieve [specific outcome]."
```

**3. Problem-Solution Demo (20 min)**

**DON'T**: Click through every feature
**DO**: Show how you solve THEIR specific problem

```
"So you mentioned you're currently [their current process]. Let me show you how this looks in CoodLoom..."

[Show specific workflow that solves their problem]

"See how that's different from [their pain point]? This means you can [benefit]."

[Check in] "Does that make sense? Questions so far?"
```

**4. Objection Handling (10 min)**

Pre-empt common objections:
```
"At this point, customers often ask about [common objection]. Here's how we handle that..."
```

**5. Closing (8 min)**
```
"So we've covered how CoodLoom solves [pain 1], [pain 2], and [pain 3]. On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to move forward?"

[If 8-10] "Great! What are next steps?"
[If 5-7] "What would get you to a 10?"
[If <5] "What are your main concerns?"
```

#### 5. Objection Handling Guide

**Common Objections & Responses**:

**"It's too expensive"**
```
"I understand price is important. Can I ask - compared to what? Because when we look at the cost of [current situation], which is [X hours/week * hourly rate], CoodLoom actually pays for itself in [timeframe]. Does that math make sense?"
```

**"We need to think about it"**
```
"Absolutely, it's an important decision. Can I ask what specifically you want to think about? [Listen] Let's address that now so you have everything you need to make a decision."
```

**"We're using [competitor]"**
```
"Great! [Competitor] is a good product. What's prompting you to look at alternatives? [Listen] Got it. Here's where we're different: [specific differentiators]. Want to see that in action?"
```

**"We need [feature you don't have]"**
```
"Good question. Can I understand more about that use case? [Listen] Here's how other customers handle that: [workaround or roadmap]. Would that work for you?"
```

**"We need to get buy-in from [others]"**
```
"Makes sense. Who specifically needs to be involved? [Listen] What concerns will they have? Let me help you make the case - I can provide [ROI calculator, case study, join next meeting]."
```

**"Can we try it for free first?"**
```
"We don't offer a free trial because [reason], but we do offer a [30-day money-back guarantee / pilot program]. If it doesn't work, you get a full refund. Fair?"
```

#### 6. Pricing & Proposal

**Pricing Discussion Framework**:

**1. Anchor on Value First**
```
"Before we talk pricing, let's review what you'll get:
- [Outcome 1]: Saves you $X/month
- [Outcome 2]: Increases revenue by $Y
- [Outcome 3]: Reduces time by Z hours/week

Total value: $[ROI]/year
```

**2. Present Options** (Good, Better, Best)
```
We have three options:

STARTER: $X/month
- [Core features]
- Best for: [Use case]

PROFESSIONAL: $Y/month (Most Popular)
- Everything in Starter
- [Additional features]
- Best for: [Use case]

ENTERPRISE: $Z/month
- Everything in Professional
- [Premium features]
- Best for: [Use case]

Based on what you've shared, I'd recommend [PROFESSIONAL] because [reason].
```

**3. Handle Price Pushback**
```
"I hear you on budget. Let's look at it this way:
- Cost: $X/month
- Savings: $Y/month
- Net value: $[Y-X]/month

You're actually making money, not spending it. Does that change the equation?"
```
