# Customer Onboarding

## Introduction
First impressions matter. A great onboarding experience sets the tone for the entire customer relationship. This chapter covers how to create a systematic onboarding process that ensures customer success.

## Why Onboarding Matters

### The Onboarding Impact
**Statistics**:
- 86% of customers stay with a company that invests in onboarding (Wyzowl)
- 55% of customers have returned a product because they didn't understand how to use it (Dimensional Research)
- Companies with strong onboarding see 50% higher customer retention

**For CoodLoom**:
- Good onboarding = Lower churn
- Bad onboarding = Quick cancellations
- Your most expensive customer touchpoint
- Your biggest opportunity to prove value

### The Critical First 30 Days
**Customer Journey**:
- **Day 0-7**: "Am I making the right decision?"
- **Day 8-14**: "Can I actually use this?"
- **Day 15-30**: "Is this worth the money?"
- **Day 30+**: "I love this!" or "I need to cancel"

**Your Goal**: Get them to "I love this!" as fast as possible

## The Onboarding Framework

### Time to Value (TTV)
**Definition**: How long until customer achieves first meaningful outcome

**Industry Benchmarks**:
- Consumer apps: < 5 minutes
- Small business SaaS: < 1 week
- Enterprise SaaS: < 30 days

**For CoodLoom**: Aim for first value within 7 days

### The Success Ladder
Each customer needs to climb these steps:

```
5. 🎯 Full Adoption (entire team using it)
4. 💪 Power User (using advanced features)
3. ✅ Regular User (daily active usage)
2. 🎉 First Win (achieved initial value)
1. 🚀 First Login (set up and configured)
```

**Your job**: Help them climb quickly

**Problem**: Unclear what "success" looks like
**Fix**: Define and measure specific outcomes

### ❌ Mistake 5: Too Sales-y
