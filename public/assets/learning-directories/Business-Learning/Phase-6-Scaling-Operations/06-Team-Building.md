# Team Building

## Introduction
Hiring your first employees is one of the most important decisions you'll make. This chapter covers how to build a high-performing team that enables scale.

## The Transition from Solo to Team

### When to Hire Your First Employee

**Signs You're Ready**:
- ✓ Product-market fit achieved
- ✓ Revenue growing consistently ($30k+ MRR)
- ✓ You're the bottleneck
- ✓ Clear role need
- ✓ 12+ months runway after hire
- ✓ Processes documented
- ✓ Can afford to spend time training

**Signs You're NOT Ready**:
- ⚠️ Still finding PMF
- ⚠️ Inconsistent revenue
- ⚠️ < 6 months runway
- ⚠️ Hoping hire will "figure it out"
- ⚠️ Don't know what you need help with

**CoodLoom Timeline**:
- **$0-30k MRR**: Just founders
- **$30-50k MRR**: First hire (CS or Sales)
- **$50-100k MRR**: 2-3 employees
- **$100k+ MRR**: Growing team (8-12 people)

### Founder Psychology

**Common Fears**:
- "What if I make a bad hire?"
- "What if they're not as committed as me?"
- "What if I can't afford them long-term?"
- "What if they leave after I train them?"
- "Can I trust someone else with my baby?"

**Reality Check**:
- Bad hires happen - learn and move on
- No one will care as much as you - that's okay
- That's why you have runway and contracts
- Train them well, treat them well, retain them
- You must trust others to scale

**Mindset Shift**: From "Do everything" → "Delegate everything possible"

- Zoom for sync

**Meetings**:
- Start on time
- Have agendas

- Record for absent team
- Default to no meeting

**Documentation**:

## Managing Your Team

- Responsible for others' success

**Key Responsibilities**:
1. Set clear expectations
2. Provide context
3. Remove blockers
4. Give feedback
5. Develop people
6. Build culture

### Effective 1-on-1s

**Frequency**: Weekly, 30 minutes

**Agenda** (Their agenda, not yours):
1. How are you? (personal check-in)
2. What went well this week?
3. What's blocking you?
4. What do you need from me?
5. Career/growth discussion

**Don't**:
- Make it a status update
- Do all the talking
- Skip regularly
- Cancel last minute
- Check your phone

### Giving Feedback

**Feedback Framework**: SBI Model

**Situation**: When/where it happened
**Behavior**: What you observed
**Impact**: Effect it had

**Example**:
"In yesterday's customer call (Situation), I noticed you interrupted the customer several times (Behavior), which made them seem frustrated and we lost the opportunity to learn their real pain points (Impact). Next time, let's practice active listening."

**Positive Feedback Too**:
"In yesterday's demo (Situation), the way you handled that pricing objection was brilliant (Behavior). The customer went from skeptical to excited, and we closed the deal (Impact). Great work!"

## When Things Don't Work Out

### Performance Issues

**Address Early**:

### Letting Someone Go

**Valid Reasons**:

**The Conversation**:

- Already decided (not negotiable)
- Final paycheck details
- Return of equipment
- Transition plan

**What to Say**:
"[Name], I've decided that today will be your last day at CoodLoom. This decision is final. [Brief reason]. Here's your final paycheck and [severance if applicable]. I need your laptop back today. I'm sorry it didn't work out."

**Keep it Short**: 5-10 minutes max

**Don't**:
- Argue or debate
- Go into excessive detail
- Make promises about references
- Let them convince you otherwise
- Do it Friday afternoon (if possible)
