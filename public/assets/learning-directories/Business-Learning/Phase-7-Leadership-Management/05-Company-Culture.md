# Company Culture

## Introduction
Culture isn't what you say—it's what you do. It's the behaviors you reward, the standards you enforce, and the examples you set. As founder of CoodLoom, you have a unique opportunity to intentionally build culture from day one. This chapter shows you how to create a culture that attracts top talent, drives performance, and scales with your company.

## What Is Company Culture?

### The Simple Definition
**Culture = The Way We Do Things Here**

It's:
- How decisions are made
- What behaviors are rewarded
- How people treat each other
- What's celebrated vs what's punished
- How conflicts are resolved
- What success looks like

### Culture Is Not
```
❌ Ping pong tables and free snacks
❌ Mission statement on the wall
❌ What you say in all-hands meetings
❌ Company values document
❌ Perks and benefits
❌ Fun team events

These can reflect culture, but they ARE NOT culture.
```

### Culture Is
```
✓ Engineer admits mistake in front of team → Praised for transparency
✓ Sales person lies to customer → Immediately fired
✓ Someone works 80 hours → Asked why systems failed, not praised
✓ Junior person disagrees with CEO → Their opinion is genuinely considered
✓ Customer issue arises → Multiple people jump to help without being asked
✓ Team member struggling → Colleagues proactively offer support

These behaviors = your actual culture
```

## Why Culture Matters

### The Business Case for Culture

**Great Culture Drives**:
```
Retention: 
- Bad culture = 50%+ annual turnover
- Great culture = <10% regrettable attrition
- Savings: $50k-200k per prevented departure

Productivity:
- Engaged employees are 17% more productive (Gallup)
- CoodLoom with 10 people: 1.7 extra people worth of output
- Multiply across years and growth

Recruiting:
- Great culture = inbound applicants
- Bad culture = struggle to fill roles
- Culture fit = faster onboarding (weeks, not months)

Performance:
- High-trust cultures = 2.5x revenue growth
- Innovation increases with psychological safety
- Speed increases with clear values

Customer Satisfaction:
- Happy employees = happy customers
- Culture of excellence = product excellence
- Values alignment = authentic customer connection
```

**Poor Culture Costs**:
```
- Constant hiring and re-training
- Low morale and productivity
- Reputation damage
- Founder burnout
- Customer churn
- Investor concerns
- Eventual company failure
```

### The Stages of Culture

**Stage 1: Founders (1-5 people)**
```
Culture = Founders' behavior
- Every action sets precedent
- Easy to course-correct
- Everyone knows everyone
- Informal norms
- Critical foundation period

Your job: Model what you want to see
```

**Stage 2: Early Team (5-20 people)**
```
Culture = Founders + First hires
- First hires amplify or dilute culture
- Need to articulate what was implicit
- Start documenting norms
- Hire for culture fit becomes critical

Your job: Hire cultural ambassadors
```

**Stage 3: Scaling (20-50 people)**
```
Culture = Systems and reinforcement
- Can't rely on osmosis anymore
- Need explicit rituals and processes
- Some founding team members may not scale
- Subcultures emerge

Your job: Systematize culture
```

**Stage 4: Mature (50+ people)**
```
Culture = Self-perpetuating system
- New employees trained by existing
- Culture deck and onboarding
- Regular culture surveys
- Dedicated people ops

Your job: Maintain and evolve
```

## Defining Your Culture

### Step 1: Define Core Values

**What Are Values?**
Core beliefs that guide behavior and decisions.

**Bad Values** (Meaningless):
```
❌ Innovation (too vague)
❌ Excellence (everyone claims this)
❌ Teamwork (says nothing specific)
❌ Integrity (baseline expectation)
❌ Customer-focused (of course you are)
```

**Good Values** (Specific, Behavioral):
```
✓ "Customer Obsession: We make decisions that might hurt short-term 
   metrics if they're right for customers long-term"

✓ "Radical Transparency: We share information openly, including 
   mistakes and challenges, even when it's uncomfortable"

✓ "Bias to Action: We make fast decisions with incomplete data and 
   iterate, rather than endlessly planning"

✓ "Own Your Outcomes: We take responsibility for results, not just 
   effort. No blame, only learning"

✓ "Raise the Bar: Every hire should raise the average talent level. 
   We're building a team of A+ players"
```

**CoodLoom Culture Exercise**:
```
Answer these questions:

1. What behaviors do you want to see daily?
2. What behaviors would cause you to fire someone?
3. What trade-offs are you willing to make?
4. What makes CoodLoom different from other companies?
5. What does success look like for a person here?

From your answers, extract 4-6 core values that:
- Are specific and behavioral
- Guide difficult decisions
- Reflect your beliefs
- Differentiate you
- Will scale as you grow
```

### Step 2: Make Values Actionable

**The Value Definition Template**:

```
Value: [Name of value]

What it means: [Simple explanation]

What it looks like:
✓ [Specific behavior example 1]
✓ [Specific behavior example 2]
✓ [Specific behavior example 3]

What it doesn't look like:
❌ [Anti-pattern 1]
❌ [Anti-pattern 2]

In practice:
- [How it affects hiring]
- [How it affects decisions]
- [How it affects conflict]

Story that exemplifies this:
[Real example from company history]
```

**Example for CoodLoom**:

```
Value: Customer Obsession

What it means: 
We start with the customer and work backwards. When in doubt, 
we do what's best for the customer, even if it costs us short-term.

What it looks like:
✓ Spending 3 hours debugging a customer's specific use case
✓ Delaying a feature launch to fix customer-reported bugs first
✓ Reaching out proactively when we know something will affect them
✓ Saying "I don't know, let me find out" instead of guessing

What it doesn't look like:
❌ Blaming users for "using the product wrong"
❌ Ignoring customer feedback because "we know better"
❌ Prioritizing new features over fixing existing issues
❌ Letting support tickets go unanswered for days

In practice:
- Hiring: Ask "Tell me about a time you went above and beyond for a customer"
- Decisions: "How does this impact customers?" is asked in every product meeting
- Conflict: If sales wants feature X but it hurts UX, we side with UX

Story:
When our early customer Sarah reported a bug at 5pm Friday, Elena 
stayed until 9pm to fix it and personally called Sarah to confirm. 
Sarah became our biggest advocate and referred 5 customers.
```

### Step 3: Create Your Culture Deck

**The Culture Deck** (Inspired by Netflix):

```
Contents (10-20 slides/pages):

1. What is CoodLoom?
   - Mission, vision, what we're building

2. Our Values (and what they mean)
   - Each value with examples

3. Behaviors We Value
   - Specific traits we look for

4. Behaviors We Don't Accept
   - Deal-breakers, even if talented

5. How We Work
   - Communication, meetings, decisions

6. What We Expect
   - From everyone at CoodLoom

7. What You Can Expect
   - From leadership and company

8. How We Hire
   - Our bar for talent

9. How We Develop People
   - Growth and learning

10. How We Make Decisions
    - RAPID, transparency, speed

Use this:
- In recruiting (share with candidates)
- In onboarding (Day 1 reading)
- In all-hands (reference constantly)
- In performance reviews (assess against values)
```

## Building Culture Daily

### The Founder's Role

**You Are the Culture**:

Everything you do is watched and copied:
- When you arrive and leave
- How you handle stress
- How you treat people
- What you celebrate
- What you tolerate
- How you make decisions
- How you communicate

**Example Scenarios**:

```
Scenario: Customer complains about bug

Your response option 1:
"Ugh, users don't understand how to use it"
→ Team learns: Blame customers

Your response option 2:
"Interesting, let's understand what they were trying to do 
and how we can make it clearer"
→ Team learns: Customer obsession


Scenario: Engineer makes expensive mistake

Your response option 1:
"How could you let this happen?!"
→ Team learns: Hide mistakes, fear taking risks

Your response option 2:
"Thanks for catching and fixing it. What did we learn? 
How do we prevent this systematically?"
→ Team learns: Transparency and learning


Scenario: Someone working 80 hours/week

Your response option 1:
Praise them publicly as "most dedicated"
→ Team learns: Overwork is expected

Your response option 2:
"Why are you working so much? Do we have a planning or 
staffing problem? Let's fix the system"
→ Team learns: Work-life balance is valued
```

### Cultural Rituals

**Why Rituals Matter**:
Repeated behaviors become culture. Intentional rituals reinforce values.

**Daily Rituals**:

```
Morning Standup (15 min):
- Quick sync, blockers, celebrations

```

### Recognition and Reinforcement

**What Gets Recognized Gets Repeated**:

**Recognize Publicly**:
```
In All-Hands:
"Shout-out to Alex, who spent their weekend helping a customer 
migrate their data. That's customer obsession in action."

In Slack:
"🎉 Sarah just closed our biggest deal! But more importantly, 
she did it by deeply understanding the customer's problem first. 
That's how we sell."

In 1-on-1s:
"I noticed how you handled that conflict with empathy and 
directness. That's exactly the kind of leadership we need."
```

**Reward Systematically**:
```
Compensation:
- Values alignment is part of performance review
- Bonuses tied to company values, not just output

Promotions:
- Must exemplify company values
- Skills alone aren't enough

Career Growth:
- People who live values get more opportunities
- Stretch projects, leadership roles, etc.
```

**Address Violations Quickly**:
```
When someone violates values:
1. Address within 24-48 hours
2. Be direct and specific
3. Explain impact on team/culture
4. Give one clear chance (unless severe)
5. Follow through on consequences

Example:
"I need to give you some direct feedback. In yesterday's meeting, 
you interrupted Maria three times and dismissed her ideas. That 
goes against our value of respect and inclusion. It made Maria 
shut down and we lost her valuable input. This can't happen again. 
How will you ensure it doesn't?"
```

## Hiring for Culture Fit

### Culture Fit vs Culture Add

**Culture Fit** (Traditional):
"Do they match our current culture?"
Risk: Homogeneity, groupthink, lack of diversity

**Culture Add** (Better):
"Do they share our values AND bring new perspectives?"
Result: Values alignment + diversity of thought

**The Balance**:
```
Must Align (Non-negotiable):
- Core values
- Work ethic
- Integrity
- Communication style (high-level)

Should Differ (Desirable):
- Background and experiences
- Perspectives and approaches
- Skills and expertise
- Personality styles
```

### Assessing Culture in Interviews

**Value-Based Interview Questions**:

**For "Customer Obsession"**:
```
"Tell me about a time you went above and beyond for a customer 
or user, even though it wasn't your job."

Listen for:
✓ Specific example with clear customer impact
✓ Taking initiative without being asked
✓ Empathy for customer's situation
✓ Following through to resolution

Red flags:
❌ Can't think of an example
❌ Blames customers for problems
❌ Only did the minimum required
```

**For "Radical Transparency"**:
```
"Describe a time you had to admit a mistake to your team or manager. 
What happened?"

Listen for:
✓ Took ownership quickly
✓ Explained what they learned
✓ Didn't make excuses
✓ Took action to prevent recurrence

Red flags:
❌ Blames others
❌ Minimizes the mistake
❌ Doesn't mention learnings
```

**For "Bias to Action"**:
```
"Tell me about a time you made a decision without having all the 
information you wanted. What was the outcome?"

Listen for:
✓ Moved quickly when needed
✓ Used available data
✓ Set up feedback loops
✓ Learned and iterated

Red flags:
❌ Analysis paralysis
❌ Waited for perfection
❌ Blamed lack of data
```

**The Culture Interview**:
```
Dedicated 30-45 min interview focused on values:

1. Introduce CoodLoom values (5 min)
2. Ask 2 questions per value (20 min)
3. Candidate asks about culture (10 min)
4. Wrap up (5 min)

Score each value: Strong Fit, Fit, Weak Fit, No Fit
Any "No Fit" = Don't hire, regardless of skills
```

### Red Flags

**Cultural Red Flags** (Don't hire):
```
❌ Badmouths previous employer excessively
❌ Takes credit for team work
❌ Blames others for failures
❌ Disrespectful to receptionist/coordinator
❌ Doesn't ask questions about culture
❌ Only talks about money/title
❌ Rigid "this is the only way" thinking
❌ Can't admit mistakes or weaknesses
❌ Late or unprepared for interview
❌ Talks over interviewer
```

**Green Flags** (Hire):
```
✓ Talks about team success, not just personal
✓ Specific examples of learning from failure
✓ Asks thoughtful questions about culture
✓ Shows genuine curiosity
✓ Respectful to everyone
✓ Excited about mission and vision
✓ Self-aware about strengths and growth areas
✓ Evidence of continuous learning
✓ Comfortable with ambiguity
✓ Coachable and open to feedback
```

## Scaling Culture

### The First Culture Crisis (Around 20-30 people)

**What Happens**:
```
- Can't onboard everyone personally
- New people don't "get it" automatically
- Subcultures form
- Original team feels culture is diluting
- Founders can't be everywhere
- What was implicit must become explicit
```

**How to Navigate**:

**1. Document Everything**:
```
Create:
- Culture deck
- Values definitions with examples
- "How we work" handbook
- Decision-making frameworks
- Meeting norms
- Communication guidelines
- Onboarding checklist
```

**2. Designate Culture Carriers**:
```
Identify 3-5 people who embody culture:
- Involve in all hiring
- Lead onboarding
- Amplify cultural messages
- Call out violations
- Model behaviors

Don't call them "Culture Police" (negative)
Call them "Culture Champions" (positive)
```

**3. Systematize Recognition**:
```
Move from:
- Ad hoc shout-outs
To:
- Structured recognition program
- Values-based awards
- Regular celebration rituals
- Public acknowledgment system
```

**4. Create Feedback Loops**:
```
Monthly Culture Survey (5 questions):
1. Do you understand our values? (1-10)
2. Do you see values in action daily? (1-10)
3. Do you feel heard and valued? (1-10)
4. Would you recommend working here? (1-10)
5. What would improve our culture?

Track trends, address issues quickly
```

### Maintaining Culture Through Growth

**50+ People**:
```
Challenges:
- Multiple teams/departments
- Layers of management
- Remote team members
- Different locations
- Acquired companies/teams

Solutions:
- Dedicated People Ops person
- Regular all-hands (don't skip)
- Cross-functional projects
- Rotation programs
- Culture ambassadors in each team
- Consistent onboarding (everyone)
- CEO still has lunch with new hires
```

**100+ People**:
```
At this scale:
- Professional HR team
- Culture deck is refined and evolved
- Formal training programs
- Leadership development
- Subcultures are acknowledged and managed
- You hire executives who protect culture
```

## Common Culture Killers

### 1. Tolerating Brilliant Jerks

**The Trap**:
```
"Yes, they're difficult, but they're so talented/productive!"

Impact:
- Good people leave
- Culture erodes
- Team becomes toxic
- Collaboration breaks down
- Innovation decreases
```

**The Solution**:
```
Netflix's approach: "Adequate performance + Great culture fit" 
beats "Brilliant performance + Culture destroyer"

Fire the brilliant jerk. Every time. Quickly.

The team will celebrate (internally or openly).
```

**How to Handle**:
```
1. Have direct conversation
   "Your work is excellent, but your behavior is damaging the team. 
   Here are specific examples. This must change."

2. Give clear expectations and timeline
   "In the next 30 days, I need to see [specific behaviors]"

3. Follow up weekly

4. If no change, let them go
   "Despite your technical skills, your behavior doesn't align 
   with our values. Today is your last day."

5. Tell the team why (without trashing them)
   "We parted ways because of cultural misalignment. We value 
   collaboration and respect above all, even technical excellence."
```

### 2. Values-Actions Mismatch

**The Trap**:
```
Say: "We value work-life balance"
Do: Praise people working weekends

Say: "We value transparency"
Do: Make decisions behind closed doors

Say: "We value diversity"
Do: Hire people all from same background

Team sees: You don't mean what you say
```

**The Solution**:
```
Audit your stated values vs actual behaviors:
- What do you reward?
- What do you punish?
- How do you spend time?
- What behaviors do leaders model?

If there's mismatch:
Either change the values or change the behaviors.
```

### 3. Growing Too Fast

**The Trap**:
```
Pressure to grow quickly → Lower hiring bar → Wrong people → 
Culture dilutes → Good people leave → More pressure to hire → 
Even lower bar → Death spiral
```

**The Solution**:
```
Grow as fast as you can hire A+ players, no faster.

Better to:
- Turn down customers
- Delay features
- Grow slower
- Miss revenue targets

Than to:
- Hire wrong people
- Destroy culture
- Lose great team members
- Build unsustainable company
```

### 4. Founder Disconnect

**The Trap**:
```
Early: Founder knows everyone, models culture daily
Later: Founder in meetings all day, team rarely sees them
Result: Culture drift, team feels disconnected
```

**The Solution**:
```
Schedule Regular:
- Lunch with random team member (weekly)
- "Office hours" (anyone can book 15 min)
- Working sessions (code/design/sales with team)
- All-hands Q&A (don't skip)
- Respond in Slack (be visible)
- Attend team events (not above it)

You set the culture. You must be present.
```

### 5. Ignoring Early Warning Signs

**Warning Signs**:
```
🚨 Increased turnover (especially of good people)
🚨 Negative Glassdoor reviews
🚨 Difficulty hiring
🚨 Lack of energy in all-hands
🚨 Complaints about "politics"
🚨 Information silos forming
🚨 Decreased collaboration
🚨 More conflict, less resolution
🚨 Low engagement survey scores
🚨 People stop speaking up
```

**The Solution**:
```
Address immediately:
1. Acknowledge there's an issue
2. Gather data (surveys, 1-on-1s, exit interviews)
3. Identify root causes
4. Create action plan
5. Communicate plan transparently
6. Execute and follow up
7. Measure improvement

Don't wait. Culture problems compound.
```

## Measuring Culture

### Quantitative Metrics

**Track Monthly**:
```
- Retention rate (overall and top performers)
- eNPS (employee Net Promoter Score)
  "Would you recommend CoodLoom as a place to work?"
- Engagement survey scores
- Time to hire (quality candidates apply faster)
- Offer acceptance rate
- Glassdoor rating
- Internal referral rate
```

**Culture Health Dashboard**:
```
🟢 Green: >90% retention, >8 eNPS, >4.0 Glassdoor
🟡 Yellow: 80-90% retention, 5-8 eNPS, 3.5-4.0 Glassdoor
🔴 Red: <80% retention, <5 eNPS, <3.5 Glassdoor

Review monthly. Act on yellow/red immediately.
```

### Qualitative Signals

**Monthly Pulse Checks**:
```
5-Question Survey (anonymous):
1. I understand our company values (1-10)
2. I see our values lived daily (1-10)
3. I feel my voice is heard (1-10)
4. I'm proud to work here (1-10)
5. What would improve our culture? (open text)

Look for trends and themes, not individual scores.
```

**Quarterly Deep Dives**:
```
30-Question Survey covering:
- Values alignment
- Leadership effectiveness
- Team collaboration
- Work-life balance
- Growth opportunities
- Compensation fairness
- Office environment
- Tools and resources

Compare to previous quarters and industry benchmarks.
```

### The Exit Interview

**When Someone Leaves** (Even if fired):
```
Ask (in person or video, not email):
1. What did you like most about working here?
2. What frustrated you most?
3. Did you feel your contributions were valued?
4. How was your relationship with your manager?
5. What would have made you stay?
6. What should we change?
7. Would you work here again in the future?
8. Would you recommend us to others?

Listen without defending. Thank them for honesty.
Take notes. Look for patterns across exits.
```
