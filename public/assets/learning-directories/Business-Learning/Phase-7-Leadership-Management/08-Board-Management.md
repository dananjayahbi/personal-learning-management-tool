# Board Management

## Introduction
If you raise funding or bring on advisors, you'll have a board of directors. Managing your board effectively is critical for getting support when you need it, avoiding interference when you don't, and maintaining a productive relationship with your investors and advisors. This chapter teaches you how to build and manage a board that helps CoodLoom succeed.

## Understanding Boards

### What Is a Board of Directors?

**Legal Definition**:
A group of people elected to represent shareholders and oversee management of the company.

**Practical Definition** (For startups):
A group that:
- Provides guidance and advice
- Holds CEO accountable
- Makes major decisions (financings, CEO changes, exits)
- Opens doors and connections
- Supports in tough times

### Board Composition Evolution

**Pre-Funding (Just You)**:
```
Board members:
- You (founder/CEO)
- Co-founder (if incorporated)

That's it. You have full control.

Decisions:
- Everything is your call
- No one to report to
- Maximum flexibility
```

**After Seed Round**:
```
Typical board:
- 1-2 Founders
- 1 Lead investor
- 1 Independent/advisor (optional)

Total: 3 people (small and nimble)

Investor control: 33%
Founder control: 67%
```

**After Series A**:
```
Typical board:
- 1-2 Founders
- 2 Investors (Seed + Series A)
- 1 Independent

Total: 4-5 people

Investor control: 40-50%
Founder control: 40-50%
Independent: Tie-breaker
```

**After Series B+**:
```
Typical board:
- 1 Founder/CEO (co-founder may leave board)
- 2-3 Investors
- 2 Independents

Total: 5-6 people

Investor control: 50%
Founder control: 16-20%
Independent: 30-40%

At this stage, you don't control the board.
Performance matters more than ownership.
```

## Building Your Board

### Choosing Board Members

**What to Look For**:

**For Investor Board Member**:
```
✓ Senior partner (not junior)
✓ Startup operating experience
✓ Pattern recognition in your space
✓ Strong network
✓ Available and responsive
✓ Reputation for being founder-friendly
✓ Chemistry with you

Questions to ask:
- "How many boards are you on?"
  (Ideal: 3-5, not 10+)
- "How often are you available between meetings?"
- "Tell me about a portfolio company that struggled. How did you help?"
- "Can I talk to 3 CEOs you work with?"

Check references!
```

**For Independent Board Member**:
```
✓ Operated at scale you aspire to
✓ Deep expertise in area you need (sales, product, etc.)
✓ Genuinely interested in helping
✓ Available (not too busy)
✓ Diverse perspective from founders/investors
✓ Well-connected

Red flags:
✗ Professional board member (too many boards)
✗ Looking for salary (should be equity only, early stage)
✗ Ego-driven (wants to run the company)
✗ Can't commit meaningful time
```

### Board Observer vs Board Member

**Board Member**:
```
- Voting rights
- Fiduciary duty
- Legally liable
- Formal role

Usually:
- Lead investors

```

**Board Observer**:
```
- Attends meetings
- No voting rights
- No fiduciary duty
- Advisory role

Usually:
- Non-lead investors
- Future investors (trial)
- Advisors
- Sometimes: Co-founder who stepped back
```

**When to Use Observers**:
```
Give observer seat to:
- Small investor who adds value
- Potential future investor
- Advisor you want feedback from

Don't give to:
- Everyone who asks

Keep observer count low (1-2 max).
```

### Advisory Board vs Board of Directors

**Board of Directors** (Formal):

Compensation:
- 0.1-0.25% equity (4 year vest)
- Or advisory fee ($X/month or meeting)
```

**For CoodLoom Early Stage**:
```
Before funding:
- Advisory board (3-5 people)
- Meet quarterly
- Compensate with small equity
- Get specific advice and connections

After funding:
- Formal board (required)

```

**Honest Assessment**:
```

```

but I'll get it to you by [specific date]."

When you disagree:
"I hear your concern. Here's how I'm thinking about it: [reasoning]. 
I'm open to other perspectives."

that. Can we discuss this more after the meeting?"

Never:

- Dismiss their concern
```

### Between Board Meetings

**Monthly Update Email**:

**Structure**:
```
Subject: CoodLoom Monthly Update - January 2025

Key Highlights:
- [Top 3 wins this month]

Key Challenges:
- [Top 2-3 challenges]

Metrics:

```

**When to Reach Out Between Meetings**:

**Definitely reach out for**:
```
- Crisis situations
- Major opportunities (acquisition interest, big partnership)
- Significant metrics change (good or bad)
- Key hire or departure
- Fundraising considerations
- Legal or regulatory issues
```

**Can reach out for**:
```
- Introductions to customers/partners
- Advice on specific decisions
- Industry insights
- Recruiting help
- Press and PR opportunities
```

**Don't bother them with**:
```
- Day-to-day decisions
- Minor updates (save for monthly email)
- Things you should figure out yourself
- Social media mentions
```

**Communication Preferences**:
```
Ask each board member:
- Email or text or Slack?
- Response time expectations?
- What level of detail do they want?
- When should I call vs email?

Respect their preferences.
```

## Managing Board Dynamics

### Getting the Most Value

**Leverage Their Expertise**:

**Before meetings**:
```
Send specific questions:
"I'd love your input on our pricing strategy. 
Could you review slides 15-18 before the meeting?"

Gives them time to think deeply.
Better advice during meeting.
```

**One-on-one sessions**:
```
Schedule 30-60 min calls quarterly (in addition to board meetings):
- Deeper on specific topics
- More candid conversations
- Build relationship
- Get coaching

Different purpose than formal board meeting.
```

**Introduce them to team**:
```
Invite board members to:
- Attend all-hands meetings
- Join customer calls
- Meet key team members
- Visit office

Helps them:
- Understand company culture
- Know the team
- Feel more connected
- Give better advice
```

### Managing Conflicts

**When Board Members Disagree**:

**Among themselves**:
```
Your role: Facilitator
- Let them debate
- Don't take sides immediately
- Synthesize different views
- Make the final call (on operational matters)
- Get alignment on path forward
```

**With you**:
```
Your approach:
- Listen fully to their concern
- Explain your reasoning
- Find common ground
- Compromise if possible
- Escalate if needed (full board vote)

Remember: They have perspective you don't.
But you have context they don't.
Both are valuable.
```

**Micromanaging board member**:
```
Politely push back:
"I appreciate your input on [topic]. I've got this handled. 
Where I really need your help is [other topic]."

Set boundaries:
"I'll keep you updated on this monthly. Let's focus our 
1-on-1 time on strategic topics where your experience is most valuable."

If continues:
Private conversation:
"I value your input, but I need space to execute. Let's discuss 
how we can work together most effectively."
```

### The Executive Session

**What It Is**:
15-30 minutes at end of board meeting, board without CEO.

**Purpose**:
- Discuss CEO performance
- Raise concerns
- Discuss sensitive topics
- Ensure CEO is getting support needed

**Your Response**:

**Don't**:
```
✗ Feel threatened or paranoid
✗ Try to avoid it
✗ Get defensive when they give feedback
```

**Do**:
```
✓ Welcome it (shows board is engaged)
✓ Ask for feedback after
✓ Listen openly
✓ Act on constructive input
```

**What they might discuss**:
```
- Is CEO performing well?
- Does CEO need more support/coaching?
- Are we concerned about anything?
- What should we communicate to CEO?
- Are there blind spots?
```

**After Executive Session**:
```
Board chair typically shares:
- Overall sentiment (positive/concerns)
- Specific feedback
- Areas where they can help more

Take it seriously, but not personally.
```

## Fundraising and Board Composition

### How Fundraising Affects Board

**Term Sheet Negotiations**:

**Board Composition Terms**:
```
Typical terms:
- "Board will consist of [X] members"
- "[Y] designated by investors"
- "[Z] designated by founders"
- "[W] independent, mutually agreed"

Example:
5-person board:
- 2 designated by investors
- 2 designated by founders
- 1 independent (both sides agree)

Negotiate these terms carefully!
```

**Board Rights to Negotiate**:

**Try to maintain**:
```
✓ Founder majority (or tied with independent)
✓ Right to choose independent board members
✓ Ability to expand board (to add more independents)
✓ Board observer limits (not unlimited)
```

**Watch out for**:
```
✗ Investor majority control
✗ Investor unilateral right to choose independents
✗ Excessive board observers
✗ Required board approval for all spending over $X (if too low)
```

### Adding New Board Members

**When Series A investor joins**:
```
Options:
1. Expand board (3 people → 4 people)
   - Previous seed investor stays
   - Series A investor joins
   
2. Replace seed investor
   - Seed investor becomes observer
   - Series A investor takes board seat

Decision factors:
- How helpful is seed investor?
- Do they want to stay?
- What's optimal board size?
```

**Adding Independent**:
```
Process:
1. Define what expertise you need
2. Get recommendations (from investors, network)
3. Interview candidates (like hiring)
4. Check references thoroughly
5. Propose to board for approval
6. Formalize with offer letter

Compensation (typical):
- 0.25-0.5% equity (4 year vest, 1 year cliff)
- No cash comp (early stage)
- D&O insurance coverage
```

## Board Best Practices

### Communication Excellence

**Be Transparent**:
```
Share the good and the bad.

Bad news doesn't age well.

If something's wrong:
- Tell them immediately
- Explain what you're doing
- Ask for help if needed

They've seen it before.
They can help.
Hiding it makes it worse.
```

**No Surprises**:
```
Rule: Board should never be surprised in a board meeting.

If big news (good or bad):
- Email them before the meeting
- Or call if very significant
- Give them time to process

Surprises → Loss of trust
```

### Meeting Efficiency

**Respect Their Time**:
```
- Start exactly on time (even if someone late)
- Send materials 3+ days before
- Keep to agenda and timeline
- End on time (or early)
- Don't waste time on stuff that could be email
```

**Focus on Value**:
```
Less time on:
- Detailed operational updates (send these beforehand)
- Reporting past results (in the deck)

More time on:
- Strategic discussions
- Problem-solving sessions
- Getting their expertise on key decisions
- Areas where they can help
```

### Building Relationships

**Beyond Board Meetings**:
```
Invest in relationships:
- Coffee or lunch one-on-one
- Introduce them to team members
- Share personal updates
- Remember details about their lives
- Ask about their portfolio/work

Strong relationship = Better advice, more help, more support in tough times
```

**Include Them in Wins**:
```
When good news:
- Customer win they helped with → Thank them publicly
- Hire they introduced → Acknowledge their help
- Advice that worked → Tell them the outcome

Recognition builds engagement.
```

## Warning Signs

   - More/less frequent meetings
   - Conflict resolution process

3. Get external help
