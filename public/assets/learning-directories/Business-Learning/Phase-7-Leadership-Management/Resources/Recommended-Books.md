## How to Read as a CEO

### Make Time
```
Block 30-60 minutes daily for reading
- Morning: Before email (best)
- Night: Before bed (also good)
- Commute: Audiobooks

30 min/day = 15-20 books/year
60 min/day = 30-50 books/year
```

### Read Actively
```
- Highlight key passages
- Write notes in margins
- Create summary doc after each book
- Share lessons with team
- Apply immediately
```

### Reading Formats
```
Physical books: Best retention, fewer distractions
Kindle: Portable, highlights sync
Audiobooks: Multitask (commute, gym, walks)
Summaries (Blinkist): Quick overview, but not a substitute

Use all three strategically.
```

### From Reading to Action
```
After each book:
1. What are the 3 key lessons?
2. What will I apply immediately?
3. What will I share with my team?
4. What will I implement in CoodLoom?

Reading without application is entertainment, not development.
