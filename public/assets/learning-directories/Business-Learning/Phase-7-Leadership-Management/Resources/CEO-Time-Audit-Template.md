## Common Time Wasters

### Email
**Average CEO time:** 28% of workday

**Optimization:**
- [ ] Batch process (2-3x/day, not constantly)
- [ ] Use filters and rules
- [ ] Delegate inbox management
- [ ] Unsubscribe aggressively
- [ ] Use templates for common responses

**Goal:** < 10% of time

### Meetings
**Average CEO time:** 72% of week

**Optimization:**
- [ ] Audit all recurring meetings (still needed?)
- [ ] Shorten default from 60m to 30m
- [ ] Require agendas or decline
- [ ] Leave meetings where you're not needed
- [ ] Have "no meeting" days

**Goal:** 40-50% of time, all high-value

### Slack/Chat
**Average CEO time:** 2-3 hours/day

**Optimization:**
- [ ] Turn off all notifications
- [ ] Batch check (like email)
- [ ] Set "office hours" for Slack
- [ ] Use status to manage expectations
- [ ] Move substantive discussions to async docs or meetings

**Goal:** < 1 hour/day

### Context Switching
**Cost:** 25% productivity loss per switch

**Optimization:**
- [ ] Block time for deep work
- [ ] Group similar tasks together
- [ ] Protect focus time (no meetings)
- [ ] One project/priority at a time

**Goal:** Minimize switches, maximize blocks

### Low-Value Activities
**Examples:**
- Expense reports
- Travel booking
- Calendar management
- Formatting documents
- Data entry
- Routine customer support

**Optimization:**
- [ ] Hire EA/admin to handle
- [ ] Automate what's possible
- [ ] Delegate to team
- [ ] Outsource
- [ ] Simply stop doing (what's the worst that happens?)

**Goal:** < 5% of your time

## CEO Time Principles

### 1. Protect Your 10%
**10% of your time** (4 hours/week) **on strategic thinking**
- No meetings
- No interruptions
- Just thinking, planning, reflecting
- Non-negotiable

### 2. Batch Similar Work
**Don't:** 1-on-1 at 9am, then 3pm, then next day
**Do:** All 1-on-1s on Tuesday/Thursday afternoons

**Reduces context switching, increases efficiency**

### 3. Match Energy to Work
**High energy (mornings for most):**
- Strategy
- Creative thinking
- Important decisions
- High-stakes meetings

**Low energy (afternoons for most):**
- Email
- Admin
- Routine meetings

### 4. Measure by Output, Not Hours
**Bad metric:** "I worked 80 hours this week"
**Good metric:** "I closed 3 key hires, shipped major feature, secured partnership"

**Focus on leverage, not effort.**

### 5. Say No to Almost Everything
**Warren Buffett:** *"The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything."*

**Each yes is a no to something else.**

### 6. Delegate Aggressively
**Ask constantly:** "Am I the only person who can do this?"
- If no → Delegate
- If yes → Still consider if it's necessary

### 7. Track and Iterate
**What gets measured gets managed.**
- Monthly time audits (light)
- Quarterly deep audits (comprehensive)
- Yearly reflection and redesign

## Remember

**Your time is the company's most valuable resource**
- You can raise more money
- You can hire more people
- You cannot get more time

**Guard it viciously**
- Every commitment is a trade-off
- Every meeting is an opportunity cost
- Every interruption has a price

**Optimize constantly**
- Track quarterly
- Eliminate ruthlessly
- Delegate aggressively
- Focus relentlessly

**The goal isn't to work less**  
**(though sustainable pace matters)**

**The goal is to work on what matters most**

Your time audit will show you the truth.  
What you do with that truth determines your success.
