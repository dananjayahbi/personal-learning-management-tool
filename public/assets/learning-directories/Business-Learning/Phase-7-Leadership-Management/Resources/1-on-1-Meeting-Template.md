## Special Situations

### When They Ask for a Raise

**Don't** say yes/no immediately.

**Do** say:
```
"Let's discuss this. Tell me:
- Why do you feel a raise is warranted?
- What market data are you seeing?
- What's changed since your last adjustment?

I want to be fair. Let me:
- Review market data
- Consider your performance
- Look at our compensation structure
- Think about timing and budget

Let's discuss this in detail at our next 1-on-1."
```

**Then**: Do your homework and come back with thoughtful response.

### When They Might Quit

**Signs:**
- Less engaged
- Not planning long-term
- Asking about other opportunities
- Changed behavior

**Ask directly:**
```
"I've noticed [observations]. How are you feeling about your role 
and the company? I want to make sure you're happy and growing here. 
Is there anything we should discuss?"
```

**If they're considering leaving:**
- Understand why
- See if it's fixable
- Don't make promises you can't keep
- Be honest about opportunities

### When You Need to Give Difficult Feedback

**Use SBI Model:**
```
Situation: "In yesterday's meeting with the customer..."
Behavior: "You interrupted them multiple times..."
Impact: "They seemed frustrated and we didn't learn what we needed."

+ Future request: "In future meetings, can you let them finish 
   their thoughts? I know you're excited, but it's important they 
   feel heard."
```

**Check understanding:**
```
"What's your perspective on this?"
"Does this feedback make sense?"
"What support do you need to work on this?"
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ DON'T:
- Cancel frequently (shows they're not a priority)
- Make it all status updates (use async tools for that)
- Do all the talking (it's their time)
- Let it become a vent session with no outcomes
- Skip the development/growth portion
- Forget to follow up on action items
- Use it only for criticism
- Let it be one-way (you talking at them)
- Be distracted (phone, laptop, thinking about other things)

### ✓ DO:
- Protect this time fiercely
- Let them drive the agenda
- Listen more than you talk
- Focus on growth and development
- Follow through on commitments
- Balance feedback (positive and developmental)
- Make it conversational, not interrogation
- Give them your full attention
- Take notes
- End on a positive note

## Remember

**1-on-1s are your highest-leverage activity**
- They build trust
- They surface issues early
- They develop your team
- They prevent surprises
- They make people feel valued

**The ROI is enormous**
- 1 hour per week per direct report
- 5 direct reports = 5 hours/week
- But prevents problems that would take 10x that time

**Make them a priority**

Your team will be as strong as your 1-on-1 game.
