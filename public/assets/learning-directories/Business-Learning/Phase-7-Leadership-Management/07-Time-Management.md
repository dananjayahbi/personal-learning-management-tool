# Time Management

## Introduction
As CEO, you'll have infinite demands on your time and finite hours in the day. Everyone wants a piece of you—team, customers, investors, partners. How you spend your time determines what gets built, what gets solved, and ultimately whether CoodLoom succeeds. This chapter teaches you how to protect your time, prioritize ruthlessly, and maximize your impact.

## The CEO Time Reality

### Your Time Is the Company's Scarcest Resource

**The Math**:
```
You have: ~60 productive hours/week (if working 70 hour weeks)
Company needs: Leadership, strategy, hiring, fundraising, sales,
               product, culture, operations, firefighting...

Reality: You can't do everything. You must choose wisely.
```

**What Happens If You Don't Manage Time**:
```
- Reactive mode: Firefighting, never strategic
- Burnout: Working 80+ hours, declining health
- Bottleneck: Team waiting on you for everything
- Poor decisions: Rushed, no time to think deeply
- Key areas neglected: Hiring, strategy, relationships
- Company suffers: Growth slows, culture degrades
```

### How CEOs Actually Spend Time (Research)

**Average CEO Time Allocation**:
```
Meetings: 60-70%
Email/Communication: 15-20%
Deep work: 10-15%
Travel: 5-10%
Personal: Whatever's left (often not enough)
```

**Where You SHOULD Spend Time** (Early-stage startup):
```
Hiring & People: 25%
   - Interviews, recruiting, 1-on-1s, culture

Product & Strategy: 20%
   - Vision, roadmap, customer feedback

Fundraising & Investors: 15%
   - When fundraising: 50%
   - Between rounds: 10%

Sales & Customers: 15%
   - Key deals, customer development, partnerships

Operations: 15%
   - Systems, processes, firefighting

Communication: 10%
   - All-hands, updates, alignment

Deep Thinking: 10%
   - Strategic planning, reflection, learning

Personal: 10%
   - Health, relationships, recovery
   (This should be non-negotiable, but often gets cut first)
```

### The Stages of CEO Time

**Stage 1: Founder-Operator (Pre-product-market fit)**
```
Time split:
- 60% Building/doing
- 30% Selling/learning
- 10% Managing

You wear all hats. You do everything.
This is appropriate early on.
```

**Stage 2: Founder-CEO (Early growth)**
```
Time split:
- 40% Strategic (vision, hiring, fundraising)
- 40% Leading (managing team, making decisions)
- 20% Doing (key areas only)

Transitioning from doer to leader.
Most painful phase.
```

**Stage 3: CEO (Scaling)**
```
Time split:
- 60% Strategic (long-term, big bets)
- 30% Leading (through managers)
- 10% Doing (only what only you can do)

You lead leaders who do the work.
```

## Time Management Principles

### Principle 1: Not All Hours Are Equal

**Your Peak Hours Are Precious**:
```
When are you sharpest?
- Morning person? 6am-10am
- Night owl? 8pm-12am
- Afternoon? 2pm-6pm

Your peak 4 hours per day:
Use for: Deep thinking, hard decisions, strategic work
Don't waste on: Email, routine meetings, administrative tasks
```

**Energy Management > Time Management**:
```
Track your energy, not just time:

High Energy Activities:
- Strategic planning
- Important decisions
- Creative work
- Key meetings

Low Energy Activities:
- Email processing
- Expense reports
- Routine 1-on-1s
- Administrative tasks

Match task difficulty to energy level.
```

### Principle 2: Maker Time vs Manager Time

**Paul Graham's Framework**:

**Manager Time**:
```
- Calendars divided into 30-min or 1-hour blocks
- Meetings back-to-back
- Reactive and responsive
- Suitable for: Interviews, 1-on-1s, status updates
```

**Maker Time**:
```
- Needs 3-4 hour uninterrupted blocks
- Deep focus work
- Creative and strategic
- Suitable for: Product strategy, writing, complex problems
```

**For CoodLoom CEO**:
```
Ideal split:
- 3 days Manager Time (Mon, Wed, Fri)
- 2 days Maker Time (Tue, Thu)

Or:
- Mornings: Maker Time (8am-12pm)
- Afternoons: Manager Time (1pm-6pm)
```

### Principle 3: Batch Similar Tasks

**Context Switching Is Expensive**:
```
Every task switch costs ~23 minutes to refocus (research).

Bad schedule:
8am: Code review
9am: Sales call
10am: Product design
11am: Interview
12pm: Investor update

Good schedule:
8am-12pm: All interviews (hiring day)
1pm-3pm: All 1-on-1s
3pm-5pm: All customer calls
```

**Batching Strategies**:
```
Meeting Days:
Mon/Wed/Fri: Back-to-back meetings
Tue/Thu: No meetings (Maker Time)

Batch by type:
- Monday: Customer/sales calls
- Tuesday: Deep work (strategy, writing)
- Wednesday: Team (all-hands, 1-on-1s)
- Thursday: Deep work (product, roadmap)
- Friday: Recruiting (interviews, offers)

Communication batching:
- Check email 3x/day (9am, 1pm, 5pm)
- Not constantly
- Respond in batches
```

### Principle 4: Protect Strategic Thinking Time

**CEO's Most Important Job**: Think strategically about the future.

**The Reality**: This gets crowded out by urgent but less important tasks.

**The Solution**: Schedule it like a meeting.

**Weekly Strategic Time**:
```
Block recurring:
- Tuesday 9am-12pm: "Strategic Work"
- Thursday 9am-12pm: "Strategic Work"

Treat like board meeting (never cancel).

Use for:
- Long-term planning
- Market analysis
- Competitive strategy
- Big decisions
- Reading and learning
- Reflection on company progress
```

**Monthly Strategic Day**:
```
One full day per month:
- Offsite (coffee shop, library, home)
- No meetings, no Slack
- Deep thinking about:
  * Company direction
  * OKRs and goals
  * Market changes
  * What's working/not working
  * Big bets to make

Output: Written strategy document, updated priorities
```

```

### Calendar Rules

**Rule 1: Time Blocking**
```
Every hour should have a purpose:
❌ Open calendar with "I'll figure it out"
✓ Blocked calendar with intentional time allocation

Block time for:
- Deep work (non-negotiable)
- Email processing (specific times)
- 1-on-1s (recurring)
- Exercise (treat like a meeting)
- Lunch (not working lunches every day)
- Buffer time (between meetings)
- Weekly review
- Strategic thinking
```

**Rule 2: Theme Days**
```
Assign themes to days:
- Monday: Customers & Sales
- Tuesday: Deep Work
- Wednesday: Team & People
- Thursday: Deep Work  
- Friday: Recruiting & Planning

Makes context switching easier.
Makes it easier to say no: "I do customer calls on Mondays"
```

**Rule 3: Office Hours**
```
Instead of ad-hoc "Can I grab 15 minutes?"

Set office hours:
- Wednesday 4-5pm: Open for anyone
- Thursday 11am-12pm: Drop-in questions

Post on Slack, respect the time.
People can book or drop in.
Reduces random interruptions.
```

**Rule 4: Meeting-Free Time**
```
Protect certain blocks:
- Before 9am: Your morning routine
- Tuesday/Thursday 9am-12pm: Deep work (NO meetings)
- 12-1pm: Lunch break
- After 6pm: Personal time (except rare exceptions)

Put these in your calendar as "Busy"
Don't let anyone book over them.
```

**Rule 5: Buffer Time**
```
Don't schedule back-to-back all day:

Include:
- 15 min buffer between meetings (prep, bathroom, notes)
- 30 min buffer for lunch (actual break)
- 30 min at end of day (wrap up, plan tomorrow)

Your calendar shouldn't be 100% booked.
```

### Meeting Management

**Before You Accept Any Meeting**:
```
Ask:
1. What's the specific goal?
2. What's the agenda?
3. Am I necessary, or can someone else go?
4. Can this be an email or doc instead?
5. Is this the right time investment?

If answers are unclear: Decline or ask for clarity first.
```

**Meeting Rules**:
```
Default Meeting Length: 25 minutes (not 30)
- Parkinson's Law: Work expands to fill time
- 25 min forces efficiency
- Gives you 5 min buffer

Standing Meetings Only:
- Weekly 1-on-1s
- Weekly all-hands
- Monthly board/investor updates
- Quarterly planning

Everything else: Question it.

No Agenda = No Meeting:
- Require agenda 24 hours before
- No agenda? Decline.
- Agenda sent at start? Reschedule.
```

**Running Efficient Meetings**:
```
Start on time (even if people missing):
- Respect those who arrived on time
- Late people learn to be on time

One person facilitates:
- Keeps discussion on track
- Manages time
- Ensures all voices heard

End with action items:
- Who, What, When
- Document in meeting notes
- Follow up on progress

End 5 minutes early:
- 55 min instead of 60
- Gives people bathroom/prep time
```

## Saying No

### The Power of No

**Every Yes Is a No to Something Else**:
```
Say yes to: Investor call
Say no to: Strategic thinking time

Say yes to: Speaking at conference
Say no to: Product roadmap work

Say yes to: Coffee with random person
Say no to: Exercise and health

Be intentional about what you say yes to.
```

### What to Say No To

**Say No To**:
```
❌ Coffee meetings with no clear purpose
❌ Conferences that don't serve strategic goal
❌ Networking events "just to network"
❌ Features requested by one customer
❌ Committees and boards (early stage)
❌ Media opportunities with low reach
❌ Mentoring/advising many other startups
❌ Social obligations that drain you
❌ Anything that doesn't serve your goals
```

**Exception**: Sometimes you need to say yes to build relationships. But be selective.

### How to Say No Gracefully

**Template Responses**:

**Vague meeting request**:
```
"Thanks for reaching out! To make sure I can be helpful, 
could you share more about:
- The specific goal of the meeting
- Questions you'd like answered
- Why you think I'm the right person

Some of these might be better addressed via [email/doc/someone else]."
```

**Conference speaking request**:
```
"Thanks for the invite! I'm being very selective about speaking 
engagements right now to focus on building CoodLoom. 

My criteria for saying yes:
- [Audience size/quality]
- [Strategic value]
- [Timing]

This doesn't quite meet those criteria, so I'll have to pass. 
But I hope it's a great event!"
```

**Investment opportunity / side project**:
```
"I appreciate you thinking of me. Right now, I'm 100% focused 
on CoodLoom and need to decline any outside commitments. 

Let me know if there's a small way I can help without a 
significant time commitment."
```

**Social obligation**:
```
"I'd love to, but I'm being really careful about my time and energy 
right now. I need to pass, but let's find another time to connect."
```

**The Key**: Don't over-explain. Don't apologize excessively. Just politely decline.

## Delegation and Leverage

### What to Delegate

**The Delegation Matrix**:
```
                    HIGH IMPACT          LOW IMPACT
                ┌─────────────────────┬───────────────┐
  ONLY YOU      │    DO YOURSELF      │   ELIMINATE   │
  CAN DO        │  (Vision, Strategy) │   (Say no)    │
                ├─────────────────────┼───────────────┤
  OTHERS        │     DELEGATE        │   AUTOMATE    │
  CAN DO        │  (Train & Empower)  │  or DELEGATE  │
                └─────────────────────┴───────────────┘
```

**Only You Can Do**:
```
- Set company vision and strategy
- Make final decisions on major issues
- Key hires (especially leadership)
- Key investor relationships
- Major customer relationships (early on)
- Culture setting and modeling
- Board management
```

**Others Can Do** (Delegate these):
```
- Day-to-day operations
- Tactical decisions
- Most hiring (you approve)
- Most customer interactions
- Most product decisions
- Internal communications
- Administrative tasks
- Data gathering and analysis
- First drafts of documents
```

### How to Delegate Effectively

**Step 1: Choose the Right Person**
```
Who has:
- Necessary skills (or can develop them)
- Available capacity
- Interest in learning
- Trust and reliability
```

**Step 2: Provide Context**
```
Explain:
- Why this matters
- How it fits bigger picture
- Success criteria
- Constraints and non-negotiables
- Resources available
- Timeline
```

**Step 3: Define Decision Authority**
```
Level 1: Do and don't tell me (low-stakes)
Level 2: Do and tell me (most tasks)
Level 3: Do and ask for input first (medium-stakes)
Level 4: Ask me before doing (high-stakes)

Be explicit about which level.
```

**Step 4: Get Out of the Way**
```
Don't:
- Micromanage
- Take it back if they do it differently
- Check in every hour
- Redo their work your way

Do:
- Be available for questions
- Check in at milestones
- Give feedback on outcomes
- Let them fail on small things
```

**Step 5: Follow Up**
```
At deadline:
- Review the work
- Give specific feedback
- Recognize good work
- Coach on improvements

Next time:
- Delegate more or differently based on results
```

### Building Your Second Brain

**Multiply Yourself**:

**Hire Executive Assistant** (When you can afford):
```
They handle:
- Calendar management
- Email triage and responses
- Expense reports
- Travel booking
- Meeting prep and notes
- Project coordination
- Research and data gathering

ROI: Saves you 10-20 hours/week
Cost: $40-80k/year (or virtual assistant $20-40k)
Break-even: When your time is worth $50+/hour
```

**Document Your Decision-Making**:
```
Create:
- Decision frameworks (write them down)
- Approval levels (what needs your input)
- Communication templates (common emails)
- Standard operating procedures

Then: Team can make more decisions without you
```

**Train Decision-Makers**:
```
Instead of: You making all decisions
Train: Team to make decisions like you would

How:
- Explain your reasoning out loud
- Let them propose solutions first
- Ask "What would you do?"
- Give feedback on their judgment
- Increase autonomy over time
```

## Energy Management

### Protect Your Health

**Non-Negotiable Self-Care**:

**Sleep** (7-8 hours):
```
Why: Cognitive function, decision-making, emotional regulation
How:
- Consistent bedtime (even weekends)
- No screens 1 hour before bed
- Dark, cool room
- No alcohol before bed

Research: CEOs who sleep <6 hours make worse decisions, 
have worse team relationships, and burn out faster.
```

**Exercise** (30 min, 4-5x/week):
```
Why: Energy, mental clarity, stress relief, health
How:
- Block it in calendar (treat like meeting)
- Morning preferred (gets it done)
- Whatever you enjoy (sustainability matters)
- Walking meetings count

Research: Exercise improves cognitive function and reduces 
decision fatigue.
```

**Nutrition** (Don't skip meals):
```
Why: Energy, focus, health
How:
- Breakfast (don't skip)
- Real lunch (not at desk)
- Healthy snacks available
- Limit caffeine after 2pm
- Hydration (64+ oz water/day)

Avoid: All-day grazing, energy drinks, skipping meals
```

**Mental Health**:
```
High-stress role. Preventative care essential:
- Therapist or coach (not weakness, strength)
- Meditation or mindfulness (10 min/day)
- Hobbies and interests outside work
- Social connections (friends, family)
- Vacation (actually disconnect)

Burnout warning signs:
- Cynicism about work
- Decreased performance
- Emotional exhaustion
- Physical symptoms (headaches, insomnia)
- Detachment from team

If experiencing: Take action immediately. You can't lead if you're burnt out.
```

### The Shutdown Ritual

**End Your Day** (15 minutes):
```
5:45pm (or whenever your day ends):

1. Review today (5 min):
   - What got done?
   - What didn't?
   - Any urgent items for tomorrow?

2. Plan tomorrow (5 min):
   - Top 3 priorities
   - Review calendar
   - Prepare for morning meetings

3. Clear your brain (5 min):
   - Write down any lingering thoughts
   - Close all tabs and apps
   - Say (out loud): "Shutdown complete"

Then: Actually stop working.

Don't: Check email "just once" at 9pm
       Check Slack "real quick" before bed
       Think about work problems all evening

Your brain needs recovery time.
```

## Time Management Tools

### Calendar Management

**Google Calendar / Outlook**:
```
Setup:
- Color code: Deep work (blue), Meetings (red), 
  Personal (green), Buffer (yellow)
- Default meeting length: 25 or 50 minutes
- Working hours set (respects boundaries)
- Meeting rooms auto-decline overlaps
- Speedy meetings on (ends 5 min early)
```

**Calendly / Scheduling Tool**:
```
For: External meetings, interviews
Setup:
- Limited availability windows
- Buffer time between meetings
- Custom questions (pre-qualify)
- Timezone handling

Saves: 10+ email exchanges per meeting
```

### Task Management

**Simple System**:
```
Tool: Notion, Asana, Todoist, or paper

Structure:
- Today: Must do (3-5 items max)
- This week: Should do (10-15 items)
- This month: Could do (20-30 items)
- Someday: Ideas and aspirations

Daily process:
- Start of day: Review today, adjust
- End of day: Review tomorrow, plan
- Weekly: Review week, plan next week
```

**The 1-3-5 Rule**:
```
Every day:
- 1 big thing (2-4 hours)
- 3 medium things (30-60 min each)
- 5 small things (5-15 min each)

Forces prioritization.
Prevents overwhelm.
Provides clarity.
```

### Communication Management

**Email**:
```
Batch process:
- 9am (15 min)
- 1pm (15 min)
- 5pm (15 min)

Use filters and labels:
- Priority: Action needed
- FYI: Read when time
- Automated: Archive

Templates for common emails:
- Intro requests
- Customer responses
- Investor updates
- Polite declines

Unsubscribe aggressively.
```

**Slack**:
```
Settings:
- Notifications off (except DMs from key people)
- Do Not Disturb: 6pm-9am, weekends
- Check deliberately (don't leave open all day)

Process:
- Check 3-4x per day
- Respond in batches
- Use threads (reduces noise)
- Mute channels you don't need

Use status:
- 🔴 In deep work (don't disturb)
- 🟡 In meetings
- 🟢 Available
```

## Time Audit

### How to Audit Your Time

**Week 1: Track Everything**:
```
Use tool (RescueTime, Toggl) or spreadsheet.

Track in 30-min increments:
- What you did
- Category (meetings, email, deep work, etc.)
- Energy level (1-10)
- Distractions (yes/no)

Do this for full week without changing behavior.
```

**Week 2: Analyze**:
```
Questions:
1. Where did time actually go?
2. How much time on high-value work?
3. How much time on low-value work?
4. How much time reactive vs proactive?
5. When was I most productive?
6. What drained my energy?
7. What gave me energy?
8. What surprised me?
```

**Week 3: Redesign**:
```
Based on insights:
- Eliminate: What can I stop doing?
- Delegate: What can others do?
- Batch: What can I group together?
- Protect: When do I need deep work time?
- Change: What habits need to shift?

Create new ideal calendar.
Test for 2 weeks.
Iterate.
```

### Regular Time Review

**Weekly Review** (Friday, 30 minutes):
```
1. How did I spend time this week?
2. Did I work on top priorities?
3. What drained time with low return?
4. What gave high return on time?
5. What will I change next week?

Adjust next week's calendar based on this.
```

**Monthly Review** (Last day of month, 60 minutes):
```
1. What were my goals this month?
2. Did my time allocation match goals?
3. What patterns do I see?
4. What's working/not working?
5. What systematic changes do I need to make?

Update your time management system.
```

## Key Takeaways

- ✓ **Time is your scarcest resource**: Protect it ruthlessly
- ✓ **Not all hours are equal**: Use peak hours for peak work
- ✓ **Manager time vs Maker time**: Need both, schedule separately
- ✓ **Batch similar tasks**: Reduce context switching cost
- ✓ **Protect strategic thinking**: Most important, most neglected
- ✓ **Say no to almost everything**: Every yes is a no to something else
- ✓ **Delegate or drown**: Others can do 70% of what you do
- ✓ **Energy > time**: Manage your energy, not just calendar
- ✓ **Sleep, exercise, health**: Non-negotiable for performance
- ✓ **Audit regularly**: What gets measured gets managed
