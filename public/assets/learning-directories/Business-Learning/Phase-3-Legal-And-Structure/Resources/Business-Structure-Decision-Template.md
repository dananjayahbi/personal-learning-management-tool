## Company Information

**Business Name**: CoodLoom Inc.
**Industry**: SaaS / Point of Sale Software
**Founders**: [Number and names]
**Location**: [State of incorporation]
**Launch Date**: [Expected launch]

## Decision Factors

### 1. Funding Plans

**Are you planning to raise venture capital?**
- [ ] Yes, definitely (angel/VC funding) → **C-Corp strongly recommended**
- [ ] Maybe in future → **C-Corp recommended**
- [ ] No, bootstrapping → **LLC or S-Corp**
- [ ] No, lifestyle business → **LLC**

**Why it matters**: VCs almost always require C-Corp due to preferred stock structure.

### 2. Growth Plans

**What's your 5-year vision?**
- [ ] Build to $100M+ valuation, potential IPO → **C-Corp**
- [ ] Grow to $10-50M, acquisition potential → **C-Corp or S-Corp**
- [ ] Profitable $1-10M business → **S-Corp or LLC**
- [ ] Lifestyle business, $500K-1M revenue → **LLC**

### 3. Tax Situation

**Current personal tax rate**: ____%

**Business Profit Expectations**:
- Year 1: $[amount] (or loss)
- Year 2: $[amount]
- Year 3: $[amount]

**Calculate tax impact**:

#### LLC / S-Corp (Pass-through)
```
Personal income: $[your current income]
+ Business profit: $[year 1 estimate]
= Total taxable income: $[sum]
× Tax rate: [your bracket]
= Personal tax: $[amount]
+ Self-employment tax (15.3% on business profit): $[amount]
= Total tax: $[amount]
```

#### C-Corp (Double taxation)
```
Business profit: $[year 1 estimate]
× Corporate tax rate (21%): = $[amount] (corporate tax)

If distributing as dividend:
Remaining profit: $[business profit - corporate tax]
× Dividend tax rate (typically 15-20%): = $[amount] (personal tax)
= Total tax: $[corporate + personal]
```

**Which is better?**
- [ ] Pass-through (lower tax in early years)
- [ ] C-Corp (planning for reinvestment, not taking dividends)

### 4. Ownership Structure

**Number of founders**: _____
**Planning to issue stock options to employees?**
- [ ] Yes, stock options critical → **C-Corp (ISOs only available to C-Corps)**
- [ ] Maybe → **C-Corp or S-Corp**
- [ ] No → **LLC**

**Will you have investors?**
- [ ] Yes → **C-Corp** (preferred stock)
- [ ] No → **LLC or S-Corp**

### 5. QSBS (Qualified Small Business Stock) Considerations

**Could you qualify for QSBS?**
- [ ] Yes, planning C-Corp with <$50M assets, operating business → **Potential $10M+ tax-free gains**
- [ ] Maybe → **C-Corp to preserve option**
- [ ] No / not applicable → **S-Corp or LLC**

**QSBS Potential Tax Savings**:
```
Exit value: $[estimate] (in 5+ years)
Your ownership: [%]
Your share: $[amount]
× QSBS exclusion (100%): = $[tax-free amount] (up to $10M)
Tax saved: $[amount × 20-37% tax rate]
```

**If QSBS applies**: Strong argument for C-Corp, even with double taxation initially

### 6. Administrative Burden

**How much complexity can you handle?**

**LLC** (Simplest):
- Minimal paperwork
- File annual report (simple)
- Flexible management
- Personal tax return (Schedule C or K-1)

**S-Corp** (Moderate):
- Annual reports
- Payroll setup (must pay yourself salary)
- Reasonable compensation requirements
- Corporate tax return (1120S)
- Personal tax return (K-1)

**C-Corp** (Most Complex):
- Board meetings (at least annually)
- Board resolutions
- Stock ledger
- Corporate tax return (1120)
- Personal tax return (W-2, dividend income)
- More legal requirements

**Your preference**:
- [ ] Minimal admin → **LLC**
- [ ] Moderate admin ok → **S-Corp**
- [ ] Can handle complexity → **C-Corp**

## Tax Projections (5-Year)

**Calculate estimated tax for each structure**:

### Scenario 1: LLC (Pass-through)

| Year | Revenue | Expenses | Profit | Self-Emp Tax (15.3%) | Income Tax | Total Tax | Take-Home |
|------|---------|----------|--------|----------------------|------------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] |
| 2 | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] |
| 3 | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] |
| 4 | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] |
| 5 | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] |

**5-Year Total Tax**: $[sum]

### Scenario 2: S-Corp (Pass-through with salary)

| Year | Revenue | Expenses | Salary (You) | Payroll Tax | Remaining Profit | Income Tax | Total Tax | Take-Home |
|------|---------|----------|--------------|-------------|------------------|------------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] |
| 2 | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] |
| 3 | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] |
| 4 | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] |
| 5 | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] |

**5-Year Total Tax**: $[sum]

### Scenario 3: C-Corp

| Year | Revenue | Expenses | Profit | Corp Tax (21%) | Dividend | Dividend Tax | Total Tax | Take-Home |
|------|---------|----------|--------|----------------|----------|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] |
| 2 | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] |
| 3 | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] |
| 4 | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] |
| 5 | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] | $[amt] |

**5-Year Total Tax**: $[sum]

**Comparison**:
- LLC tax: $[sum] over 5 years
- S-Corp tax: $[sum] over 5 years (Savings vs LLC: $[diff])
- C-Corp tax: $[sum] over 5 years (Savings vs LLC: $[diff])

**But consider**: QSBS (C-Corp) could save $[amt] on exit, dwarfing annual tax differences

## Exit Scenario Analysis

**Assume exit in Year 5**:

**Exit valuation**: $[10M example]
**Your ownership**: [50% example] = $[5M]

### LLC or S-Corp Exit:
```
Sale proceeds: $5,000,000
Capital gains tax (20% federal + 3.8% NIIT): $1,190,000
State tax (CA 13.3% example): $665,000
Total tax: $1,855,000
Net proceeds: $3,145,000
```

### C-Corp Exit (with QSBS):
```
Sale proceeds: $5,000,000
QSBS exclusion (100% up to $10M): -$5,000,000
Taxable gain: $0
Total tax: $0
Net proceeds: $5,000,000

Tax saved vs LLC: $1,855,000
```

**QSBS Impact**: Saving $1.8M+ on exit far outweighs extra ~$50K in corporate taxes over 5 years

## Common Situations & Recommendations

### Situation 1: Tech Startup, Planning VC Funding
**Recommendation**: **Delaware C-Corp**
- VC requirement
- ISOs for employees
- QSBS benefits
- Industry standard

### Situation 2: Bootstrap SaaS, Profitable Soon
**Recommendation**: **S-Corp** or **C-Corp** (if QSBS attractive)
- S-Corp: Tax efficient while profitable
- C-Corp: If planning eventual sale and QSBS savings > annual tax difference

### Situation 3: Consulting / Services Business
**Recommendation**: **LLC** or **S-Corp**
- LLC: Simplest if small
- S-Corp: Tax savings when profitable

### Situation 4: Lifestyle Business, No Exit Plan
**Recommendation**: **LLC**
- Maximum simplicity
- No plans for investors or sale
- Lowest admin burden

### Situation 5: Unclear / Too Early
**Recommendation**: **LLC** → Convert to C-Corp Later
- Start simple
- Convert when raising funding (costs $2K-5K)
- Slight risk: QSBS clock doesn't start until C-Corp
