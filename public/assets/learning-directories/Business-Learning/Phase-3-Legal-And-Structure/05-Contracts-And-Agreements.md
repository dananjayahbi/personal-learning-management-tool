# Contracts & Agreements: Legal Documents for CoodLoom

## Introduction

Contracts are the foundation of business relationships. Every interaction with customers, employees, contractors, vendors, and partners should be documented with proper agreements.

**This chapter covers the essential contracts you need to operate CoodLoom legally and protect your interests.**

## Why Contracts Matter

### The Cost of No Contract

**Scenario 1: The Unpaid Customer**
- Customer uses CoodLoom for 6 months
- Stops paying, claims software "doesn't work"
- No written contract specifying terms
- **Result**: Can't collect payment, $30K loss

**Scenario 2: The Departing Contractor**
- Hired developer to build feature
- No written contract
- Developer claims they own the code
- Demands $50K to transfer rights
- **Result**: Pay ransom or rebuild feature

**Scenario 3: The Scope Creep Customer**
- Agreed to build custom feature for $10K
- No statement of work
- Customer keeps requesting changes
- "You promised this would be included!"
- **Result**: Endless work, no additional payment

**Prevention**: Proper contracts for every business relationship

### SaaS vs Licensed Software

**SaaS Model** (Recommended for CoodLoom):
- Customer accesses via web/cloud
- No installation on customer premises
- Subscription-based
- Continuous updates
- Easier to enforce (cut off access if non-payment)

**Licensed Software**:
- Customer installs on their servers
- Perpetual license or term license
- Customer controls updates
- Harder to enforce compliance

**Recommendation**: SaaS model with subscription licensing

## 2. Terms of Service (ToS)

- More informal

**License Agreement**:

## 3. Service Level Agreement (SLA)

### What It Is

Commitment to service availability and performance. Defines what happens if CoodLoom doesn't meet commitments.

### Key Metrics

**Uptime Commitment**:
```
SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT

Uptime Guarantee: [99.9%] uptime per month

Calculation: 
- Month = 730 hours (average)
- 99.9% = 730 * 0.999 = 729.27 hours
- Allowable downtime: 43.8 minutes per month

Exclusions (don't count against SLA):
- Scheduled maintenance (with [72 hours] advance notice)
- Customer's internet or equipment issues
- Force majeure events (natural disasters, etc.)
- Issues caused by Customer's misuse
- Third-party service failures beyond our control

Measurement: Based on CoodLoom's monitoring systems
```

**Performance Standards**:
```
Response Time: Page load time < [2 seconds] for 95% of requests
Transaction Processing: Complete within [5 seconds]
API Response Time: < [500ms] for 99% of calls
```

**Credits for Non-Compliance**:
```
SLA CREDITS

If uptime falls below guaranteed level, Customer receives credit:

Uptime         | Credit
---------------|--------
99.0 - 99.9%   | 10% of monthly fee
98.0 - 99.0%   | 25% of monthly fee
< 98.0%        | 50% of monthly fee

Credit Limitations:
- Maximum credit: 50% of monthly fee
- Credit applied to next month's invoice
- No cash refunds
- Customer must request credit within [30 days]

Sole Remedy: Credits are Customer's sole remedy for SLA breach.
```

**Support Response Times**:
```
SUPPORT SLA

Priority | Response Time | Resolution Target
---------|---------------|------------------
Critical | 1 hour       | 4 hours
High     | 4 hours      | 24 hours
Medium   | 24 hours     | 5 business days
Low      | 48 hours     | 10 business days

Critical Issues: Complete service outage, data loss, security breach
High Issues: Major functionality impaired
Medium Issues: Non-critical functionality impaired
Low Issues: Questions, feature requests
```

### Should CoodLoom Offer SLA?

**Pros**:
- Builds trust with enterprise customers
- Competitive differentiation
- Shows confidence in infrastructure
- Required by many large customers

**Cons**:
- Financial liability if breach
- Need robust monitoring
- Pressure to maintain high uptime
- May limit maintenance windows

**Recommendation**:
- **Early stage**: No formal SLA (or 99% informally)
- **With enterprise customers**: 99.5-99.9% SLA
- **At scale**: 99.9% or higher

**Typical SaaS SLAs**:
- 99.9% (43.8 min downtime/month): Industry standard
- 99.95% (22 min/month): Premium
- 99.99% (4.4 min/month): Mission-critical
- 99.999% (26 sec/month): Extremely expensive

## Contract Negotiation Tips

### Negotiating Customer Contracts

**What to Push Back On**:
- Unlimited liability (always cap)
- Indemnification for everything (limit scope)
- Source code escrow (expensive, negotiate out)
- Right to audit (limit frequency, notice period)
- Exclusive rights (retain right to serve other customers)

**What to Accept**:
- Reasonable security requirements
- Standard confidentiality
- Right to terminate for cause
- Background checks for employees accessing their data

**Red Flags**:
- "Perpetual, irrevocable license" (you can never terminate)
- Personal guarantees (risk your personal assets)
- Unreasonable indemnification (you're liable for everything)
- Assignment of all IP (they own your improvements)

### Standard Terms to Always Include

**Every Contract Should Have**:
1. **Parties**: Full legal names
2. **Effective Date**: When contract starts
3. **Term**: Duration (and auto-renewal if applicable)
4. **Termination**: How either party can end
5. **Payment Terms**: Amount, frequency, late fees
6. **Warranties**: What you promise (and disclaim)
7. **Limitation of Liability**: Cap on your exposure
8. **Indemnification**: Who pays if sued
9. **Governing Law**: Which state's laws apply
10. **Dispute Resolution**: Arbitration vs litigation
11. **General Provisions**: Entire agreement, severability, amendments
12. **Signatures**: Both parties sign and date
