# Founders Agreement: Protecting Your Partnership

## Introduction

**The #1 reason startups fail isn't lack of funding or bad products—it's co-founder conflict.**

A Founders Agreement is the prenup of business partnerships. It documents everything you and your co-founder agree on today, so there's no confusion tomorrow. Most importantly, it protects both of you when things don't go as planned.

**This chapter covers the most critical legal document for CoodLoom: your Founders Agreement.**

## Why You Absolutely Need This

### The Brutal Statistics

- **65%** of startups fail due to co-founder conflict
- **73%** of founding teams split before exit
- Average time before co-founder split: **18 months**

### Real-World Horror Stories

**Story 1: The 50/50 Deadlock**
- Two founders, 50/50 split, no vesting
- Disagree on company direction after 6 months
- Neither can make decisions
- Company stuck, can't fundraise
- **Result**: Shut down after 1 year

**Story 2: The Departed Founder**
- Founder leaves after 3 months with 40% equity (no vesting)
- Remaining founder builds company for 5 years
- Exit for $10M
- Departed founder gets $4M for 3 months work
- **Result**: Remaining founder bitter, relationship destroyed

**Story 3: The Side Project**
- No IP assignment agreement
- Founder claims they own the code (built before incorporation)
- VC due diligence finds unclear IP ownership
- **Result**: Lost $2M funding round

### What a Founders Agreement Prevents

✅ Disputes over equity split
✅ Uncertainty about roles and responsibilities
✅ Founders leaving with too much equity
✅ IP ownership questions
✅ Deadlock in decision-making
✅ Unfair outcomes when someone doesn't pull their weight
✅ Confusion about time commitment
✅ Issues with outside work or competing businesses

## Core Components of a Founders Agreement

Every Founders Agreement should cover these 8 critical areas:

### 1. Equity Split
### 2. Vesting Schedule
### 3. Roles & Responsibilities
### 4. Time Commitment
### 5. Intellectual Property
### 6. Decision-Making Process
### 7. Founder Departure
### 8. Conflict Resolution

Let's dive deep into each:

## 1. Equity Split: Who Owns What

### The Difficult Conversation

This is often the hardest discussion between co-founders. But it must happen **before** you incorporate.

### Factors to Consider

**Equal vs Unequal Split**:

**50/50 Split**:
- **Pros**: 
  - Simple
  - Shows equal partnership
  - No hurt feelings initially
- **Cons**:
  - Deadlock potential
  - May not reflect actual contributions
  - Doesn't account for founder who had the idea
  - VCs don't like it (want clear leader)

**Unequal Split** (e.g., 60/40, 55/45):
- **Pros**:
  - Recognizes different contributions
  - Clear leader for tough decisions
  - More realistic
  - VCs prefer
- **Cons**:
  - Can create resentment
  - Junior partner may feel undervalued
  - Hard to determine "right" split

### Factors for Determining Split

**Consider These**:

1. **Idea Origin** (10-20%):
   - Who had the original idea?
   - How developed is it?
   - Does it matter? (Execution > Idea)

2. **Domain Expertise** (20-30%):
   - Industry knowledge
   - Technical expertise
   - Business experience

3. **Initial Capital** (10-30%):
   - Who invested money?
   - How much?
   - Is it a loan or equity?

4. **Time Commitment** (20-40%):
   - Full-time vs part-time
   - When will each go full-time?
   - Who left their job first?

5. **Risk Taken** (10-20%):
   - Who has more to lose?
   - Financial obligations
   - Career risk

6. **Skills & Network** (10-20%):
   - Complementary skills
   - Network value
   - Ability to raise funding

### CoodLoom Example

**Your Situation**:
- You: Technical founder, built the POS system
- Co-founder: Business side, has capital

**Possible Splits**:

**Option A: 50/50**
- **Reasoning**: Equal partners, equal risk
- **Best if**: Both equally committed, trust is high
- **Watch out**: Deadlock risk

**Option B: 60/40** (You get 60%)
- **Reasoning**: You built the product, technical founder
- **Best if**: You're CEO, final decision-maker
- **Watch out**: Co-founder must feel valued

**Option C: 55/45** (You get 55%)
- **Reasoning**: Slight edge for sweat equity
- **Best if**: Want near-equality with tiebreaker
- **Watch out**: May not be meaningful difference

**Option D: 50/50 with Lead Founder**
- **Reasoning**: Equal equity, but one is CEO with deciding vote
- **Best if**: Want equality but need clear leader
- **Watch out**: Need strong governance documents

### The Dynamic Equity Model

**Problem**: Hard to predict future contributions

**Solution**: Start with baseline, adjust over time based on contributions

**How It Works**:
- Track hours, capital, ideas, relationships
- Quarterly or annual recalculations
- Complex to manage
- Software: Slicing Pie calculator

**Pros**:
- Fair based on actual contributions
- Motivates continued effort

**Cons**:
- Complex
- Can create ongoing disputes
- VCs don't like it
- Hard to track

**Recommendation**: Not recommended. Better to use vesting.

### Equity Split Decision Framework

**Step 1**: Each founder independently fills out:

```
EQUITY ASSESSMENT WORKSHEET

Your Name: _________________
Co-founder Name: _________________

Rate each factor 1-10 for yourself and co-founder:

Factor                    | You | Co-founder
--------------------------|-----|------------
Idea origination          |     |
Industry expertise        |     |
Technical skills          |     |
Business skills           |     |
Capital invested          |     |
Time commitment (hrs/wk)  |     |
Risk taken                |     |
Network value             |     |
Leadership ability        |     |
Fundraising ability       |     |
--------------------------|-----|------------
TOTAL                     |     |

Your Equity %: _____ %
Co-founder Equity %: _____ %
```

**Step 2**: Share results with each other

**Step 3**: Discuss differences honestly

**Step 4**: Agree on split

**Step 5**: Document in writing

**Step 6**: MOVE ON - Don't revisit constantly

### Recommended Split for CoodLoom

Based on typical tech startup patterns:

**If you're CEO/technical founder**: **55/45** or **60/40** (you get majority)
- You built the product
- You'll be CEO
- Need tiebreaker for decisions

**If truly equal partnership**: **50/50** BUT:
- Designate one person as CEO
- CEO gets deciding vote
- Document in bylaws

**Whatever you choose**: 
- Both must agree it's fair
- Add vesting (see next section)
- Put it in writing
- Don't revisit for at least 1 year

## 2. Vesting Schedule: Earning Your Equity

### What Is Vesting?

**Vesting**: Your equity is earned over time, not granted all at once.

**Why Critical**: Protects against a founder leaving early with full equity.

### Standard Vesting Terms

**4-year vesting with 1-year cliff**:

**4 years**: Total time to earn all equity
**1-year cliff**: Must stay 1 year to earn anything
**Monthly after cliff**: Earn 1/48 of total equity each month

### How It Works

**Example**: You get 4,000,000 shares (50% of 8,000,000)

**Timeline**:
- **Month 0**: 0 shares vested (you own 4M, but they're restricted)
- **Month 6**: 0 shares vested (haven't hit cliff)
- **Month 12** (cliff): 1,000,000 shares vest (25%)
- **Month 13**: 1,083,333 shares vested (1M + 1/48)
- **Month 24**: 2,000,000 shares vested (50%)
- **Month 36**: 3,000,000 shares vested (75%)
- **Month 48**: 4,000,000 shares vested (100%)

**If you leave**:
- Before 12 months: **0 shares** (company buys back all)
- At 18 months: **Keep 1.5M shares**, company buys back 2.5M
- After 48 months: **Keep all 4M shares**

### Why the 1-Year Cliff?

**Protects against**:
- Founder realizes startup isn't for them
- Founder underperforms
- Founder had different expectations
- Life circumstances change

**Gives company time to**:
- Evaluate commitment
- See if partnership works
- Replace founder if needed

**Without cliff**: Founder could leave after 1 month with 1/48 of equity

### Variations

**Accelerate vesting in certain events**:

**Single-Trigger Acceleration**:
- Vesting accelerates upon acquisition/sale
- Example: 50% or 100% vests immediately when company sold
- **Pros**: Protects founders in acquisition
- **Cons**: Acquirer may not want it

**Double-Trigger Acceleration**:
- Requires TWO events: (1) Acquisition AND (2) Termination
- Example: If acquired and you're fired within 1 year, 50% accelerates
- **Pros**: Standard for acquisitions
- **Cons**: More complex

**No Acceleration**:
- Vesting continues as normal
- **Pros**: Simplest
- **Cons**: Founder might lose unvested in acquisition

**Recommendation for CoodLoom**: 
- Standard 4-year/1-year cliff
- Double-trigger acceleration (50% on acquisition + termination)
- Review after 1 year

### The 83(b) Election - CRITICAL!

**What**: IRS form that changes when you pay taxes on vesting stock

**Standard Tax Treatment** (WITHOUT 83(b)):
- You pay ordinary income tax on the value of shares **as they vest**
- If stock increases in value, huge tax bill

**Example WITHOUT 83(b)**:
- You get 4M shares at $0.0001/share = $400 value
- Year 1: 1M vest, stock now worth $1/share = $1M income
- **Tax bill**: $370,000 (37% bracket) on paper gains
- You don't have cash, only stock!

**With 83(b) Election**:
- File within 30 days of stock grant
- Pay tax on $400 (current value) immediately
- Future gains taxed as capital gains, not income

**Example WITH 83(b)**:
- You get 4M shares at $0.0001/share = $400 value
- **Tax bill**: $96 (24% bracket) 
- 4 years later: Sell for $10M
- Tax: Capital gains on $10M (preferential rate)

**Requirements**:
- File within **30 days** of stock grant
- No extensions, no exceptions
- Miss it = disaster

**How to File**:
1. Complete IRS Form 83(b)
2. Mail to IRS (address depends on location)
3. Include copy with your tax return
4. Send copy to company
5. Keep proof of mailing (certified mail)

**Cost**: $0 + postage

**Recommendation**: **ALWAYS FILE 83(b) with vesting stock**

### Reverse Vesting

**What**: You're given all shares upfront, but company can buy them back if you leave

**How It Works**:
- Day 1: You own 4M shares
- If you leave before 1 year: Company buys back all 4M at cost
- If you leave at 18 months: Company buys back 2.5M at cost

**Same economic result as forward vesting, different structure**

**Why Used**: 
- Simpler for closely-held companies
- Some states prefer it

[Your Name], Founder              CoodLoom, Inc.
Date: ___________                By: [CEO Name], CEO
                                 Date: ___________
```

## 3. Roles & Responsibilities

### Why Define Roles

**Prevents**:
- "That's not my job" syndrome
- Duplicate work
- Important tasks falling through cracks
- Resentment over unequal workload

**Enables**:
- Clear accountability
- Efficient division of labor
- Measuring performance
- Easier to identify when roles need to change

### Typical Co-Founder Role Splits

**Tech Company Pattern**:

**Founder 1** (Technical):
- Title: CEO & CTO or CTO
- Responsibilities:
  - Product development
  - Technology strategy
  - Engineering team (later)
  - Infrastructure/DevOps
  - Security
  
**Founder 2** (Business):
- Title: CEO & COO or COO
- Responsibilities:
  - Sales & marketing
  - Finance & operations
  - Customer success
  - Fundraising
  - Legal/compliance

**Alternative**: Co-CEOs (rare, VCs don't like)

### CoodLoom Role Definition Example

**You** (Technical Founder):
- **Title**: CEO or CTO (decide!)
- **Primary**: Product & Engineering
- **Responsibilities**:
  - CoodLoom POS software development
  - Technical architecture decisions
  - Hiring engineers (later)
  - Product roadmap (jointly with co-founder)
  - Customer technical support (initially)
  - Infrastructure management
  - Security & compliance (technical aspects)

**Co-Founder** (Business Founder):
- **Title**: COO or CFO
- **Primary**: Business & Operations
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Sales & lead generation
  - Customer relationships
  - Financial management
  - Fundraising & investor relations
  - Marketing strategy & execution
  - Operations & processes
  - Legal & compliance (business aspects)
  - Hiring business team (later)

**Shared Responsibilities**:
- Strategic direction
- Major decisions (see decision-making section)
- Company culture
- Board presentations
- Investor updates
- Annual planning

### The CEO Question

**Who should be CEO?**

**Factors to Consider**:
1. Who interfaces with investors? (CEO typically)
2. Who is better at big-picture strategy?
3. Who do customers expect to see?
4. Who is more comfortable with public role?
5. Who wants the pressure?

**For CoodLoom**:

**Option A**: You are CEO (common for technical founders)
- **If**: You want to be CEO (your stated goal)
- **If**: You're good at communication & strategy
- **If**: Co-founder is comfortable with COO role

**Option B**: Co-founder is CEO
- **If**: They have more business experience
- **If**: They're better at fundraising/sales
- **If**: You prefer focusing on product

**Option C**: Co-CEOs
- **Generally not recommended**: VCs dislike, creates confusion
- **Only if**: Truly equal partnership, exceptional communication

**Recommendation**: One person is CEO, the other is COO/CTO. Decide based on:
- Who's better at external relationships (fundraising, big partnerships)
- Who wants the title more
- Who will investors prefer (often technical founder for tech company)

### Documenting Roles

**In Founders Agreement**:

```
3. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

3.1 Titles and Roles
- [Your Name] shall serve as [Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology 
  Officer], responsible for: [list responsibilities]
  
- [Co-founder Name] shall serve as [Chief Operating Officer], responsible 
  for: [list responsibilities]

3.2 Role Changes
- Roles may be adjusted by mutual agreement of founders
- Major changes require Board approval
- Title changes require Board approval

3.3 Performance Review
- Founders will review each other's performance annually
- Provide constructive feedback
- Adjust responsibilities as needed

3.4 Decision-Making Authority
- Each founder has authority to make decisions within their domain up to 
  $[5,000] without approval
- Decisions over $[5,000] require joint approval
- See Section 6 for major decisions requiring Board approval
```

### Role Evolution

**Expect roles to change**:
- Initially: Everyone does everything
- Early stage (0-10 employees): Still wearing many hats
- Growth stage (10-50 employees): Specialization increases
- Scale stage (50+ employees): Founders become managers

**Example Evolution**:

**Year 1**: 
- You: 70% coding, 20% sales, 10% ops
- Co-founder: 70% sales, 20% ops, 10% finance

**Year 2**:
- You: 50% coding, 30% product mgmt, 20% hiring
- Co-founder: 50% sales, 30% ops, 20% fundraising

**Year 3**:
- You: 20% coding, 50% product/eng mgmt, 30% strategy
- Co-founder: 30% sales, 40% ops, 30% finance/fundraising

**Year 5**:
- You: 0% coding, 70% strategy/mgmt, 30% vision
- Co-founder: 20% sales mgmt, 50% ops, 30% finance

**Be flexible**: Roles should serve the business, not egos

## 4. Time Commitment

### Why Document This

**Common Scenario**:
- Founder A: Full-time, 60+ hours/week
- Founder B: "Full-time" but also consulting on side, 30 hours/week
- Resentment builds
- Company suffers

### Full-Time vs Part-Time

**Full-Time Definition**:
- 40+ hours per week
- No other employment
- Primary focus
- Available during business hours

**Part-Time Definition**:
- Specific hours per week (e.g., 20 hours)
- May have other commitments
- Clear schedule
- Not sustainable long-term for equal equity

### Transition Plans

**Common Situation**: Can't both quit jobs immediately

**Options**:

**Option A: Both Quit Together**
- **Pros**: Equal commitment from start
- **Cons**: Highest risk, need runway

**Option B: Staggered Transition**
- Founder A quits now (technical/product)
- Founder B quits in 3-6 months (when $ needed for sales)
- **Pros**: Reduces risk
- **Cons**: Unequal effort initially

**Option C: Both Part-Time, Then Full-Time**
- Both keep jobs initially
- Transition when revenue or funding
- **Pros**: Lowest risk
- **Cons**: Slow progress, maybe not serious

**For CoodLoom**:

**If you have runway** (6-12 months expenses):
- **Both go full-time immediately**
- Shows commitment
- Maximizes progress
- **Recommended** if possible

**If limited runway**:
- Technical founder (you) full-time
- Business founder part-time (20+ hours) for 3-6 months
- Transition when milestones hit:
  - $10K MRR, or
  - Closed beta users, or
  - Ready to fundraise

### Documenting Time Commitment

```
4. TIME COMMITMENT

4.1 Initial Commitment

- [Your Name] commits to full-time employment (40+ hours/week) beginning 
  [Date]. No outside employment or consulting.
  
- [Co-founder Name] commits to [full-time/part-time: 20 hours per week] 
  beginning [Date]. [If part-time: Will transition to full-time by [Date] 
  or upon reaching [milestone].]

4.2 Expectations

Full-time founders are expected to:
- Work minimum 40 hours per week
- Be available during core business hours (9am-5pm local time)
- Attend all required meetings
- Not engage in outside employment without prior written approval
- Make CoodLoom their primary professional focus

4.3 Outside Activities

Founders may engage in the following without approval:
- Angel investing (time commitment < 5 hours/month)
- Speaking engagements related to CoodLoom
- Board positions at non-competing companies (max 1, with approval)
- Teaching/mentoring (< 5 hours/month)

4.4 Monitoring

- If a founder's commitment appears insufficient, co-founder may raise issue
- Regular check-ins (weekly) to discuss workload and expectations
- Insufficient commitment may constitute grounds for termination for Cause
```

### The Side Project Problem

**Common Issue**: Founder wants to keep side business/project

**Problems**:
- Time dilution
- Attention dilution
- Potential IP conflicts
- Competitive concerns

**Solutions**:

**Option A: No Outside Work** (Recommended)
- Full focus on startup
- Exception: Angel investing, advisory roles (limited time)

**Option B: Allowed with Restrictions**
- Must be disclosed
- Cannot compete
- Cannot interfere with duties
- IP from side project stays with founder

**Option C: Wind Down Period**
- 30-90 days to transition out of other commitments
- Then full focus on startup

**For CoodLoom**: **No outside work** if both full-time with equal equity

## 5. Intellectual Property Assignment

### Why This Is Critical

**Scenario Without IP Assignment**:
- You built POS software before incorporating
- Company incorporated
- You didn't formally assign IP to company
- Later: Investor due diligence questions who owns software
- You claim: "I do, I built it"
- **Result**: Lost funding round, broken trust, legal battle

**With IP Assignment**:
- Crystal clear: Company owns all IP
- Due diligence: ✓ Clean
- Funding: ✓ No issues

### What IP to Assign

**Everything related to the business**:

**Code & Software**:
- All existing CoodLoom POS code
- Prior versions and prototypes
- Related tools and scripts
- Documentation

**Intangible Property**:
- Domain names (coodloom.com, etc.)
- Trademarks and brand names
- Logos and designs
- Business methods
- Customer lists (if any)

**Content**:
- Marketing materials
- Website content
- Presentations
- Training materials

**Inventions**:
- Any patents or patent applications
- Trade secrets
- Proprietary processes

### Work Product

**All future work** created during employment belongs to company:
- Code written
- Features developed
- Designs created
- Documentation written
- Ideas and inventions

**Standard Rule**: If created using company time, resources, or related to company business → Company owns it

### Prior Inventions

**Problem**: You might have other projects/IP you want to keep

**Solution**: List "Prior Inventions" that are excluded

**Example**:
```
Schedule A: Prior Inventions

The following inventions developed prior to my employment are excluded 
from this assignment:

1. [Personal website/blog] - Personal project, unrelated to CoodLoom
2. [Open source library X] - Contributed to before CoodLoom, MIT license
3. [Mobile app Y] - Personal project, unrelated to POS systems

Everything else developed during my time with CoodLoom belongs to the Company.
```

**Be Complete**: List everything now, can't add later

### IP Assignment Agreement

Should cover:

```
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT

1. ASSIGNMENT OF PRIOR IP

Founder hereby assigns to Company all right, title, and interest in:

(a) The CoodLoom point-of-sale software, including:
    - All source code
    - All design documents
    - All prior versions
    - All related IP
    
(b) Domain names: coodloom.com, [list others]

(c) Trademarks: "CoodLoom" and related marks

(d) All other IP related to the Company's business, except as listed 
    in Schedule A (Prior Inventions)

2. ASSIGNMENT OF FUTURE WORK PRODUCT

Founder agrees that all work product created during employment with 
Company automatically belongs to Company, including:
- Software and code
- Inventions and discoveries
- Designs and specifications
- Content and documentation
- Improvements and modifications

3. ASSISTANCE

Founder agrees to assist Company in obtaining patents, copyrights, 
trademarks, including signing documents and providing testimony.

4. COMPENSATION

This assignment is made in consideration for Founder receiving 
[4,000,000] shares of Company stock valued at $[X].

SIGNATURES: [Both parties]
```

**Timing**: Sign **at or before** incorporation, not after!

## 6. Decision-Making Process

### The Deadlock Problem

**50/50 ownership** + **Disagreement** = **Deadlock**

**Example**:
- You want to focus on enterprise customers
- Co-founder wants to focus on SMB
- No mechanism to break tie
- Company can't move forward

**Solutions**:

### A. Designate CEO with Final Say

**Structure**:
- Both founders have 50% equity
- One is CEO
- CEO has final say on operating decisions
- But: Major decisions still require both

**Pros**:
- Clear decision-maker
- Can't get stuck
- CEO has accountability

**Cons**:
- Other founder might feel powerless
- Requires strong trust

**Implementation**:
```
One founder shall serve as CEO. In the event of disagreement on 
operating decisions, the CEO shall have final decision-making authority. 

However, Major Decisions (defined below) require unanimous approval.
```

### B. Tiered Decision Framework

**Three tiers of decisions**:

**Tier 1: Individual Authority**
- Daily operational decisions
- Decisions within founder's domain
- Spending up to $[5,000]
- **Who Decides**: Responsible founder

**Tier 2: Joint Founder Approval**
- Spending $[5,000] - $[25,000]
- Hiring decisions
- Product roadmap
- Marketing campaigns
- Partnership agreements
- **Who Decides**: Both founders must agree

**Tier 3: Board Approval**
- Major Decisions (see list below)
- **Who Decides**: Board of Directors (includes founders + any investors)

### C. Major Decisions Requiring Unanimous Approval

**Always require both founders (and Board if applicable)**:

**Financial**:
- Raising capital (equity or debt)
- Spending over $[25,000] (adjust based on company size)
- Loans over $[10,000]
- Change in banking relationships
- Acquisition of another company
- Sale of company assets
- Annual budget approval

**Corporate Structure**:
- Issuing new equity
- Amending bylaws or certificate of incorporation
- Changing business purpose
- Dissolving company
- Bankruptcy filing

**Key People**:
- Hiring C-level executives
- Firing founders or C-level
- Changing founder roles or titles
- Equity grants over [X] shares

**Strategic**:
- Pivoting business model
- Entering new markets
- Major partnership agreements (> $[50K] value)
- Selling company
- Major product changes

**Legal**:
- Lawsuits (filing or settling > $[25K])
- Major contracts (> $[50K] annual value)
- IP licensing or sale

### D. Conflict Resolution Escalation

**When founders disagree**:

**Level 1: Discussion** (1 week)
- Founders discuss privately
- Present arguments and data
- Try to reach consensus
- Goal: Understand other's perspective

**Level 2: Advisor Input** (1 week)
- Bring in trusted advisor or mentor
- Present both sides
- Get outside perspective
- Non-binding advice

**Level 3: Board Decision** (1 week)
- Present to Board of Directors
- Board votes on resolution
- Binding decision
- If no board yet, move to Level 4

**Level 4: Mediation** (2-4 weeks)
- Hire professional mediator
- Structured mediation process
- Try to reach agreement
- Cost: $[2,000-5,000]

**Level 5: Arbitration** (last resort)
- Binding arbitration
- Arbitrator makes decision
- Legally enforceable
- Cost: $[10,000-50,000]

**Timeline**: If disagreement not resolved in 6 weeks, arbitration is automatic

### E. Voting Control

**If unequal equity**:

**60/40 Split**:
- Majority founder (60%) can make decisions

## 7. Founder Departure

### The Uncomfortable Truth

**Most co-founder relationships don't last to exit.**

You need to plan for:
- Voluntary resignation
- Termination for cause
- Termination without cause
- Death or disability
- Mutual departure

### Reasons Founders Leave

**Voluntary**:
- Different vision for company
- Burned out
- Health or family issues
- Better opportunity elsewhere
- Conflict with co-founder
- No longer believe in company

**Involuntary**:
- Poor performance
- Ethical violations
- Breach of agreement
- Criminal activity
- Competing with company

**Unavoidable**:
- Death
- Permanent disability
- Immigration issues

### What Happens to Equity?

**Vested Shares**:
- **Keep them**: Founder earned these
- Exception: Termination for Cause (see below)

**Unvested Shares**:
- **Forfeited**: Returned to company
- Bought back at original cost (often $0.00001/share = pennies)

**Example**:
- Founder has 4M shares, 48-month vesting
- Leaves at month 20
- **Vested**: 1.67M shares (keep)
- **Unvested**: 2.33M shares (forfeited)

### Termination For Cause

**Definition of "Cause"**:
- Gross negligence or willful misconduct
- Breach of fiduciary duty
- Fraud or embezzlement
- Criminal conviction
- Breach of agreement (IP, non-compete, etc.)
- Competing with company
- Failure to perform duties after written warning

**Consequence**:
- Immediate termination
- Unvested shares forfeited
- **Possibly**: Company can buy back vested shares at cost
- No severance

**High Bar**: "Cause" should be serious, not just disagreements

### Termination Without Cause

**Reasons**:
- Company changing direction
- Founder not working out
- Personality conflicts
- Performance issues (but not egregious)

**Consequence**:
- Unvested shares forfeited (per vesting schedule)
- Vested shares keep
- Possible severance (if agreed)

### Good Leaver vs Bad Leaver

**Used in some agreements**:

**Good Leaver**:
- Voluntary resignation with notice
- Termination without cause
- Mutual agreement
- Death or disability
- **Treatment**: Keeps vested shares, normal repurchase of unvested

**Bad Leaver**:
- Termination for cause
- Resignation without notice
- Breach of agreement
- Competing with company
- **Treatment**: May forfeit some or all shares, including vested

**Bad Leaver Provisions** can be harsh:
- Company buys back ALL shares (vested + unvested) at cost
- Means founder leaves with almost nothing

**Recommendation**: Use "Bad Leaver" only for egregious behavior (cause), not just poor performance

### Repurchase Rights

**Company Option to Repurchase**:

**When Triggered**:
- Founder leaves (voluntarily or involuntarily)
- Founder's unvested shares
- Optionally: Vested shares too

**Price**:
- **Unvested**: Original cost (often $0.00001/share)
- **Vested**: Fair market value OR original cost (negotiate)

**Timeline**:
- Company has [60-90 days] to exercise option
- If not exercised, founder keeps shares

**Payment**:
- Cash immediately, OR
- Promissory note over [1-3 years]

**Why Important**: 
- Keeps equity pool available for new hires/founders
- Prevents departed founder from blocking decisions

**Founder-Friendly Approach**:
- Company buys back unvested at cost (standard)
- Founder keeps vested shares
- Optional: Right of first refusal if founder wants to sell

**Company-Friendly Approach**:
- Company can buy back ALL shares at FMV
- Founder must sell if company wants to buy
- Prevents departed founder from benefiting from future success

**Balanced Approach** (Recommended):
- Founder keeps vested shares
- Company buys unvested at cost
- Drag-along rights (founder must participate in sale of company)
- Right of first refusal (company can match any outside offer)

### Non-Compete & Non-Solicit

**Non-Compete**:
- Founder agrees not to compete with company
- Typically: [1-2 years] after departure
- Geography: [Where company operates]
- Scope: [Specific to company's business]

**Example**:
```
For [18 months] following termination, Founder shall not:
- Start a competing POS software company
- Work for a direct competitor
- Solicit Company's customers for competing products
```

**Enforceability**: Varies by state
- California: Non-competes largely unenforceable
- Other states: Enforceable if reasonable (time, geography, scope)

**Recommendation**: Keep narrow and reasonable (12-18 months, specific to direct competition)

**Non-Solicit**:
- Founder agrees not to recruit company's employees or contractors
- Typically: [1-2 years] after departure
- More enforceable than non-compete

**Example**:
```
For [18 months] following termination, Founder shall not:
- Solicit any Company employee to leave
- Hire any Company employee or contractor
- Encourage customers to stop using Company's services
```

**Recommendation**: Include non-solicit (reasonable, enforceable)

### Death or Disability

**Plan for the worst**:

**Death**:
- Vesting stops
- Estate keeps vested shares
- Company has option to repurchase vested shares from estate
- Life insurance on founders (recommended $500K-1M each)

**Disability**:
- Define: "Unable to perform duties for [90 consecutive days] or [120 days in any 12-month period]"
- Vesting stops after disability period
- Company can terminate
- Disability insurance (recommended)

**Life Insurance**:
- **Key Person Insurance**: Company owns policy on founders
- **Benefit**: $500K-2M (enough to hire replacement + cushion)
- **Cost**: $50-200/month per founder
- **Trigger**: Pay to company upon death
- **Use**: Hire replacement, fund operations

### Departure Process

**Notice Period**:
- Departing founder must give [30-60 days] notice
- Exception: Termination for cause (immediate)

**Transition**:
- Departing founder assists with transition
- Knowledge transfer
- Introduction to key contacts
- Documentation

**Return of Property**:
- Laptop, phone, equipment
- Access credentials
- Confidential information
- Company credit cards

**Non-Disparagement**:
- Neither party will speak negatively about the other
- Applies to founders and company
- Protects reputation

- **Faster**: 1-2 sessions
- **Try first**

**Arbitration**:

### Irreconcilable Differences

**If founders truly can't work together**:

**Option A: One Founder Buys Out the Other**
- Negotiate buyout price
- Typically based on:
  - Company valuation
  - Vested equity percentage
  - Contributed capital
- Payment terms: Cash or promissory note
- Departing founder signs non-compete

**Example**:
- Company valued at $1M
- Each founder has 50%, 50% vested = 25% of company
- Buyout: $250,000
- Payment: $50K cash + $200K note over 4 years

**Option B: Sell the Company**
- Both founders agree to sell
- Hire investment banker or broker
- Split proceeds per equity ownership
- Clean exit for both

**Option C: Shut Down the Company**
- Mutually agree to wind down
- Pay debts
- Distribute remaining assets
- Hardest emotionally but sometimes best

**Option D: Russian Roulette Clause**
- One founder offers to buy other's shares at specific price
- Other founder must either:
  - (A) Accept and sell, OR
  - (B) Buy offering founder's shares at same price
- Forces fair pricing
- Nuclear option

## Creating Your Founders Agreement

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **"We'll figure it out later"**: Founders agreements get harder after conflict starts

❌ **Verbal agreements only**: Not enforceable, memories differ

❌ **50/50 without tiebreaker**: Recipe for deadlock

❌ **No vesting**: Departed founder keeps full equity

❌ **Vesting but no 83(b)**: Massive tax bill later

❌ **No IP assignment**: Unclear who owns what

❌ **Generic template without lawyer review**: May not be enforceable

❌ **Signing without understanding**: Read and understand every clause

❌ **Not revisiting**: Should review annually and after major changes

❌ **Letting emotions dictate**: Make decisions rationally, not emotionally
