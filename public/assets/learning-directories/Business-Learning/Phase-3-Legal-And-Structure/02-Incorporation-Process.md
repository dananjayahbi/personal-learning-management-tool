- **Stockholder meetings**: Annual
- **Option grants**: As hire employees
- **Cap table updates**: After any stock transaction

**Set Up Reminders**:
- [ ] Calendar reminders for all deadlines
- [ ] Share with co-founder and accountant
- [ ] Budget for annual costs

### Phase 6: Post-Incorporation Best Practices

#### Maintain Corporate Formality

**Why**: To preserve limited liability protection

**Do's**:
✅ Keep business and personal finances separate
✅ Hold required meetings (board, shareholders)
✅ Document all major decisions
✅ File annual reports on time
✅ Pay required taxes and fees
✅ Sign contracts as CEO of company, not personally
✅ Use proper company name on everything
✅ Issue stock properly with certificates
✅ Maintain adequate capitalization

**Don'ts**:
❌ Commingle personal and business funds
❌ Use business account for personal expenses
❌ Make major decisions without board approval
❌ Ignore corporate formalities
❌ Let company become insolvent
❌ Sign contracts personally instead of as officer
❌ Treat company assets as personal property

**If You Don't**: "Piercing the corporate veil" - lose liability protection, personally liable

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Waiting too long to incorporate**: Incorporate before:
- Signing contracts with customers
- Hiring employees
- Receiving significant revenue
- Raising money

❌ **Not vesting founder stock**: See Chapter 3

❌ **Forgetting IP assignment**: Must transfer BEFORE or AT incorporation

❌ **Using generic templates without review**: Every situation is different

❌ **Not maintaining corporate formality**: Ruins limited liability

❌ **Commingling funds**: Death of limited liability

❌ **Missing filing deadlines**: Penalties and possible dissolution

❌ **Not documenting decisions**: No board minutes = problems later

❌ **Issuing stock without 83(b)**: Massive tax bill when vesting

❌ **Operating without insurance**: One lawsuit = bankruptcy

❌ **Not filing beneficial ownership report**: $500/day fine!
