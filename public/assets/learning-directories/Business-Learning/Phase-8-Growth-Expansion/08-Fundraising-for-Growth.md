# Fundraising for Growth

## Introduction
You've bootstrapped to product-market fit. Now you're considering raising capital to accelerate growth. But should you? When? How much? From whom? This chapter covers everything you need to know about raising growth-stage capital - from seed rounds to Series A, B, and beyond.

## Key Concepts

### 1. To Raise or Not to Raise?

**Reasons TO Raise Capital:**
- ✓ Clear path to 10x growth with capital
- ✓ Winner-take-all market (need to move fast)
- ✓ Capital-intensive business model
- ✓ Competitive threat requires speed
- ✓ Acquisition opportunities
- ✓ Want to attract top talent (equity packages)
- ✓ Large market opportunity you can capture

**Reasons NOT to Raise:**
- ✓ Profitable and growing nicely
- ✓ Don't have clear use for capital
- ✓ Market is not winner-take-all
- ✓ Don't want to give up control
- ✓ Lifestyle business goals
- ✓ Can achieve goals without capital
- ✓ Would raise at poor valuation

**Key Question**: Will this capital help us grow 10x faster? If not, maybe don't raise.

### 2. Funding Stages

**Pre-Seed** ($100K-500K)
- Stage: Idea to prototype
- From: Friends, family, angels
- Traction: None to minimal
- Typical dilution: 10-20%

**Seed** ($500K-$2M)
- Stage: MVP to early customers
- From: Seed funds, angels, micro-VCs
- Traction: 10-50 customers, $10K-100K ARR
- Typical dilution: 15-25%

**Series A** ($2M-$15M)
- Stage: Product-market fit to scale
- From: VC firms
- Traction: $1M-$5M ARR, 100-500 customers
- Typical dilution: 20-30%

**Series B** ($10M-$50M)
- Stage: Scaling to market leader
- From: Growth VCs
- Traction: $5M-$20M ARR, 500-2000 customers
- Typical dilution: 15-25%

**Series C+** ($30M-$100M+)
- Stage: Market leader to IPO prep
- From: Late-stage VCs, PE
- Traction: $20M-$100M+ ARR
- Typical dilution: 10-20%

**For CoodLoom**: You're likely at Seed to Series A stage if you have PMF.

### 3. Valuation Basics

**How Valuation Works:**

```
Post-Money Valuation = Pre-Money Valuation + Investment Amount

Example:
- Pre-Money Valuation: $8M
- Investment: $2M
- Post-Money Valuation: $10M
- Investor Ownership: $2M / $10M = 20%
- Founder Ownership: 80% (if you owned 100% before)
```

**Valuation Methods:**

**1. Comparable Companies (Public Markets)**
- Look at revenue multiples of public companies
- Example: SaaS companies trade at 5-15x revenue
- If you're at $2M ARR, valuation might be $10M-$30M

**2. Comparable Transactions (Private Markets)**
- Similar companies' funding rounds
- Adjust for stage, growth rate, market

**3. Venture Capital Method**
- Work backwards from exit
- If exit in 7 years at $100M, need 10x return
- Therefore invest at $10M post-money valuation

**4. Scorecard Method**
- Compare to average pre-revenue startup
- Adjust for team, product, market, etc.

**Reality**: Valuation is mostly negotiation and market conditions. Growth rate is biggest driver.

**SaaS Valuation Multiples (2023-2024):**
- High growth (>100% YoY): 15-20x revenue
- Mid growth (50-100% YoY): 10-15x revenue
- Moderate growth (30-50% YoY): 5-10x revenue
- Slow growth (<30% YoY): 3-5x revenue

**Example for CoodLoom:**
- ARR: $2M
- Growth: 80% YoY
- Multiple: 10-12x
- Valuation: $20M-$24M

### 4. Dilution and Ownership

**Understanding Dilution:**

**Start (You + Co-founder):**
- You: 50%
- Co-founder: 50%

**After Seed ($1M at $4M post-money):**
- You: 37.5% (50% × 75%)
- Co-founder: 37.5%
- Investors: 25%

**After Series A ($5M at $20M post-money):**
- You: 28.1% (37.5% × 75%)
- Co-founder: 28.1%
- Seed Investors: 18.8%
- Series A Investors: 25%

**After Series B ($10M at $50M post-money):**
- You: 22.5% (28.1% × 80%)
- Co-founder: 22.5%
- Seed Investors: 15%
- Series A Investors: 20%
- Series B Investors: 20%

**Your 22.5% of a $50M company = $11.25M**

**Better than 100% of a $1M company!**

**Key Insight**: Dilution is okay if the pie is growing faster.

## Understanding Term Sheets

### Key Terms Explained

**1. Valuation**
```
Pre-Money Valuation: $_____
Investment Amount: $_____
Post-Money Valuation: $_____ (Pre + Investment)
```

**2. Liquidation Preference**
- Who gets paid first in exit/liquidation

**1x Non-Participating** (Standard, founder-friendly):
- Investor gets max of: 1x investment OR their ownership %
- Example: $2M invested for 20%, company sells for $15M
  - Option 1: $2M (1x)
  - Option 2: $3M (20% of $15M)
  - They take $3M

**1x Participating** (Investor-friendly):
- Investor gets 1x investment PLUS their ownership %
- Same example: $2M + (20% × $13M) = $4.6M
- Less for founders!

**Negotiate**: Always push for non-participating.

**3. Board Structure**
- Who controls the company

**Example:**
- 2 founder seats
- 2 investor seats
- 1 independent seat
- **Total**: 5 seats

**Maintain Control**: Don't give investors majority.

**4. Anti-Dilution**
- Protects investors if you raise at lower valuation (down round)

**Broad-Based Weighted Average** (Fair):
- Adjusts based on amount raised and valuation drop
- Balanced protection

**Full Ratchet** (Investor-heavy):
- Converts as if they invested at new lower price
- Very dilutive to founders

**Negotiate**: Broad-based weighted average or none.

**5. Pro-Rata Rights**
- Right to invest in future rounds to maintain ownership %
- **Standard**: Give to major investors (>10% ownership)

**6. Drag-Along**
- Majority shareholders can force minority to sell
- **Standard**: Protects against holdouts in acquisition

**7. Vesting**
- Founder shares vest over time (typically 4 years)
- Ensures commitment

**Standard Vesting:**
- 4 years total
- 1 year cliff (nothing until year 1)
- Then monthly vesting

**8. Option Pool**
- Shares reserved for employee stock options
- **Note**: Often comes out of founders' ownership

**Example:**
- Pre-money valuation: $8M
- Option pool: 15% (created before investment)
- This dilutes founders BEFORE investment
- Investment: $2M for 20% post-money

**Negotiate**: Create pool post-investment or smaller %.

### Negotiating Term Sheets

**What's Negotiable:**
- ✓ Valuation (but not worth dying on hill if close)
- ✓ Liquidation preference (must be 1x, non-participating)
- ✓ Board seats (maintain control)
- ✓ Option pool size
- ✓ Anti-dilution (get broad-based or none)

**What's Standard (Don't Fight):**
- Pro-rata rights (for major investors)
- Drag-along rights
- Standard representations and warranties
- Information rights

**What to Avoid:**
- ✗ Participating liquidation preference
- ✗ Full ratchet anti-dilution
- ✗ Investor board control
- ✗ Guaranteed returns
- ✗ Redemption rights (investors can force buy-back)

**Negotiation Tips:**
- Have multiple term sheets (leverage!)
- Use lawyer who knows startup deals
- Focus on deal terms, not just valuation
- Think long-term (you'll raise again)
- Relationship matters (you're picking partner)

## Common Fundraising Mistakes

### 1. Raising Too Early
**Mistake**: Raising before PMF
**Problem**: Waste time, poor valuation, or get rejected
**Solution**: Prove traction first

### 2. Optimistic Projections
**Mistake**: "We'll be at $50M ARR in 3 years!"
**Problem**: Lose credibility, miss projections
**Solution**: Conservative base case, upside scenario

### 3. Talking to Too Few Investors
**Mistake**: Only meeting with 5 VCs
**Problem**: No leverage, miss good fits
**Solution**: Talk to 20-40, get 2-3 term sheets

### 4. No Warm Introductions
**Mistake**: Cold emailing VCs
**Problem**: Low response rate, looks desperate
**Solution**: Get intros from founders, customers, advisors

### 5. Fundraising When Desperate
**Mistake**: Starting with 2 months of runway
**Problem**: Accept bad terms, rushed diligence
**Solution**: Start with 12+ months runway

### 6. Accepting First Term Sheet
**Mistake**: Saying yes immediately
**Problem**: Miss better offers, poor terms
**Solution**: Shop the term sheet, negotiate

### 7. Not Using a Lawyer
**Mistake**: Signing documents without legal review
**Problem**: Miss bad terms, future problems
**Solution**: Hire experienced startup lawyer

## Case Studies
