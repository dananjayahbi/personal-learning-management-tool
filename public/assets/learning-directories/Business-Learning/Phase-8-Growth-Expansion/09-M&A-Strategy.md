# M&A Strategy (Mergers & Acquisitions)

## Introduction
You've built a growing company. Now you're considering acquisitions to accelerate growth, or maybe someone wants to acquire you. M&A can be a powerful growth strategy or a lucrative exit. This chapter covers both sides: buying companies and being acquired.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Why Companies Do M&A

**Strategic Reasons:**
- **Acquire Technology**: Get product/tech faster than building
- **Acquire Talent**: Hire a whole team at once ("acqui-hire")
- **Acquire Customers**: Buy customer base
- **Enter New Markets**: Geographic or vertical expansion
- **Eliminate Competition**: Remove competitor
- **Consolidate Market**: Roll up fragmented industry
- **Vertical Integration**: Own more of value chain

**Financial Reasons:**
- **Accelerate Growth**: Faster than organic
- **Economies of Scale**: Lower per-unit costs
- **Increase Valuation**: 1+1=3 synergies
- **Tax Benefits**: Utilize losses
- **Return on Cash**: Deploy excess capital

**For CoodLoom Examples:**
- Acquire competitor in new city (customers + market entry)
- Acquire complementary product (inventory management software)
- Acquire implementation agency (services revenue + customers)
- Get acquired by payment processor (exit for founders)

### 2. Types of Acquisitions

**Horizontal Acquisition:**
- Buy competitor or similar company
- Example: CoodLoom acquires another restaurant POS
- **Rationale**: Market share, eliminate competition

**Vertical Acquisition:**
- Buy supplier or distributor
- Example: CoodLoom acquires payment processor
- **Rationale**: Own more value chain, better margins

**Acqui-hire:**
- Buy for team, not product
- Example: Acquire agency with POS implementation expertise
- **Rationale**: Hard to hire, faster team building

**Product Acquisition:**
- Buy for technology/product
- Example: Acquire inventory management software
- **Rationale**: Faster than building, proven solution

**Customer Acquisition:**
- Buy for customer base
- Example: Acquire legacy POS with 500 customers
- **Rationale**: Cheaper than organic customer acquisition

**Roll-up:**
- Buy multiple small companies, consolidate
- Example: Acquire 10 regional POS companies
- **Rationale**: Fragmented market, economies of scale

### 3. Acquisition Success Factors

**Successful Acquisitions Have:**
- ✓ Clear strategic rationale
- ✓ Cultural fit
- ✓ Reasonable price
- ✓ Integration plan
- ✓ Key talent retention
- ✓ Complementary strengths

**Failed Acquisitions Often:**
- ✗ Overpay significantly
- ✗ Cultural clash
- ✗ No integration plan
- ✗ Key people leave
- ✗ Distraction from core business
- ✗ Hidden problems emerge

**Statistics**: 70-90% of acquisitions fail to create value. Be careful!

### 4. Valuation Basics

**How to Value an Acquisition Target:**

**For Revenue-Generating SaaS:**
```
Valuation = ARR × Multiple

Multiples vary by:
- Growth rate (faster = higher)
- Profitability (profitable = higher)
- Retention (higher = higher)
- Market (hot market = higher)

Typical Range: 3-10x ARR
```

**Example:**
- Target: $1M ARR
- Growth: 50% YoY
- Profitable: No, burning $200K/year
- Retention: 85%
- **Multiple: 4-5x**
- **Valuation: $4M-$5M**

**For Acqui-hires:**
```
Valuation = # of Engineers × $500K-$1M

Example:
- 5 engineers
- Valuation: $2.5M-$5M
```

**Other Methods:**
- Asset-based (value of assets minus liabilities)
- DCF (discounted cash flow - future earnings)
- Comparable transactions (what similar companies sold for)

## Acquiring Companies (You as Buyer)

### When to Make Acquisitions

**Good Time to Acquire:**
- ✓ You have strong core business
- ✓ Clear strategic need
- ✓ Capital available (raised or profitable)
- ✓ Management bandwidth to integrate
- ✓ Found compelling target

**Bad Time to Acquire:**
- ✗ Core business struggling
- ✗ "Because we can" (no strategy)
- ✗ No capital or would strain finances
- ✗ Team is already underwater
- ✗ Just window shopping

**Rule of Thumb**: Core business must be healthy before doing M&A.

### Finding Acquisition Targets

**Sources:**

**1. Direct Outreach**
- Identify targets (competitors, complementary products)
- Reach out to founders
- "Not for sale" today, but plant seed

**2. Investment Bankers**
- They represent sellers
- Will bring you deals
- Take 3-10% commission (seller pays)

**3. Business Brokers**
- For smaller deals (<$5M)
- Platforms: BizBuySell, Flippa

**4. Your Network**
- Other founders
- Investors
- Advisors
- Industry contacts

**5. Distressed Assets**
- Companies running out of cash
- Can negotiate better price
- But higher risk (reason for distress?)

**Building Your Target List:**

**Criteria:**
- Strategic fit (product, market, customers)
- Size (can you afford it?)
- Technology (compatible?)
- Team (want to retain?)
- Customers (would they stay?)
- Culture (compatible?)

**Example for CoodLoom:**

| Company | Type | ARR | Rationale | Fit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| QuickPOS | Competitor | $2M | 300 customers in Texas | High |
| InventoryPro | Product | $500K | Add-on product | Medium |
| Resto-Tech Agency | Services | $1M | Implementation services | Medium |

### The Acquisition Process

**Stage 1: Initial Conversation (Week 1-2)**

```

**Stage 4: Due Diligence (Week 7-12)**

**Financial Diligence:**
- Verify revenue and expenses
- Customer contracts review
- Accounts receivable/payable
- Tax returns
- Liabilities and debts
- Working capital needs

**Legal Diligence:**
- Corporate documents
- Material contracts
- IP ownership

- Compliance with laws

**Technical Diligence:**
- Code review
- Architecture assessment
- Security audit
- Technical debt
- Scalability
- Integration complexity

**Customer Diligence:**
- Retention analysis
- Customer concentration
- NPS/satisfaction
- Support tickets
- Churn reasons

**Team Diligence:**
- Key person risk
- Retention plan
- Culture assessment
- Compensation review

**Red Flags:**
- Revenue declining
- Major customer concentration (>20% from one customer)
- Legal issues (lawsuits, IP disputes)
- Technical debt (code is mess)
- Key people planning to leave
- Hidden liabilities
- Overstated financials

**Stage 5: Definitive Agreement (Week 13-16)**
- Final purchase price
- Detailed terms
- Representations and warranties
- Indemnification
- Closing conditions
- Legal documentation (100+ pages!)

**Use Lawyer!** M&A deals are complex legally.

- All conditions satisfied
- Board approval
- Regulatory approval (if needed)
- Wire transfer
- Announce deal
- Integration begins

**Total Timeline: 3-6 months** (can be faster for small deals)

### Structuring the Deal

**Purchase Price Components:**

**1. Cash (Upfront)**
- Paid at closing
- Simplest, cleanest
- Requires capital

**2. Stock (Equity)**
- Buyer's company stock
- Aligns interests long-term
- Tax-efficient for seller
- Vests over time (typically 2-4 years)

**3. Earnout (Contingent)**
- Additional payment based on future performance
- Example: $1M upfront + $500K if hit revenue target
- Bridges valuation gap
- Can cause conflict (seller wants to hit target, buyer wants conservative)

**4. Seller Financing**
- Seller receives payments over time
- Like loan from seller
- Good if buyer lacks capital
- Risk for seller

**Typical Mix for CoodLoom Acquiring $2M ARR Company:**
- Cash: $2M (50%)
- Stock: $1M (25%, vests over 2 years)
- Earnout: $1M (25%, if 90% customer retention over 2 years)
- **Total: $4M**

**Asset Purchase vs. Stock Purchase:**

**Asset Purchase** (Common for smaller deals):
- Buyer purchases specific assets (customer list, IP, contracts)
- Doesn't assume liabilities
- More tax-efficient for buyer
- Cleaner

**Stock Purchase** (Common for larger deals):
- Buyer purchases company stock
- Assumes all liabilities
- Tax-efficient for seller
- Simpler legally

**For most SaaS acquisitions**: Asset purchase is preferred.

### Integration Planning

**Pre-Close (Before deal closes):**
- Form integration team
- Identify quick wins
- Retention plan for key people
- Communication plan
- Technical integration plan

**Common Integration Mistakes:**
- Moving too fast (confusion)
- Moving too slow (uncertainty)

- Alienating customers

### Retaining Key People

**Golden Handcuffs:**

**Retention Bonuses:**
- Pay key people to stay
- Example: $50K bonus if stay 1 year
- Vests over time

**Equity Grants:**
- New stock options in acquiring company
- Aligns with new company's success
- Typically 2-4 year vesting

**Employment Contracts:**
- Minimum employment period

- **CTO**: 1-year employment, $130K salary, $100K stock vesting
- **Key Engineers**: $25K retention bonus each after 1 year

**But**: Best retention is making them excited about the future!

## Being Acquired (You as Seller)

### Sale Price Negotiation

**Understanding Your Worth:**

**For SaaS Companies:**
```
Valuation = ARR × Multiple × Adjustment Factors

Base Multiple:
- $0-$1M ARR: 3-5x
- $1M-$5M ARR: 4-7x
- $5M-$20M ARR: 6-10x
- $20M+ ARR: 8-15x

Adjustment Factors:
+ Fast growth (>50% YoY): +20-50%
+ Profitable: +10-30%
+ High retention (>95%): +10-20%
+ Large market: +10-20%
+ Strategic buyer: +20-100%

- Slow growth (<20% YoY): -20-40%
- Unprofitable with high burn: -10-30%
- High churn (>10% annually): -20-40%
- Customer concentration: -10-30%
```

**Example for CoodLoom:**
- ARR: $5M
- Growth: 60% YoY
- Churn: 8% annually (okay, not great)
- Burn: $100K/month
- **Base Multiple: 6-7x**
- Growth adjustment: +30%
- Churn adjustment: -10%
- **Effective Multiple: 7x**
- **Valuation: $35M**

**Negotiating Tips:**

**Have Leverage:**
- Multiple bidders (best leverage)
- Not desperate (can walk away)
- Business is growing
- Other options (continue building, raise capital)

**Focus on Total Deal Value:**
- Not just headline number
- Consider: Cash, stock, earnouts, employment
- Employment terms (salary, duration, role)

**Understand Earnouts:**
- Earnouts are risky (you may not get them)
- Prefer cash and stock over earnouts
- If earnout, make targets achievable
- Get control over earnout metrics

**Representations and Warranties:**
- You guarantee things about the business
- Breaches can reduce purchase price
- Indemnification cap (limit liability)
- Escrow (10-20% held back 12-18 months)

**Tax Optimization:**
- Asset sale vs. stock sale (different tax treatment)
- QSBS exemption (can exclude capital gains)
- Installment sale (spread taxes over years)
- **Consult tax advisor!**

### Alternatives to Selling

## Congratulations!

You've completed Phase 8: Growth & Expansion. You now understand:
- Growth strategy frameworks
- Market expansion (geographic & vertical)
- Product expansion strategies
- Strategic partnerships
- Marketing channel diversification
- Building sales teams
- Customer success operations
- Fundraising for growth
- M&A strategy (buying and selling)

**What's Next:**

**Phase 9: Empire Building** covers:
- Scaling to enterprise
- Building economic moats
- Category creation
- Acquisitions at scale
- Going public (IPO)
- Building a business empire

But remember: Most companies never need Phase 9. Building a great $10M, $50M, or even $100M company is an incredible achievement. Not every company needs to be a unicorn.

**Choose Your Path:**
- Continue to Phase 9 (Empire building)
- Master execution of Phases 0-8
- Build the company you actually want

---

**Remember**: M&A is a tool, not a goal. Use it when it accelerates your mission. Whether you buy, sell, or stay independent - there's no wrong choice. Build the company you want to build, on your own terms.
