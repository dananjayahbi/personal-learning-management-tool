# Marketing Channels

## Introduction
You've been growing through word-of-mouth and direct sales, but to scale beyond product-market fit, you need diversified customer acquisition channels. This chapter covers how to identify, test, and scale marketing channels that drive predictable, profitable growth.

## Key Concepts

### 1. The Marketing Channel Lifecycle

**Stage 1: Experimental** (Month 1-3)
- Small budget ($500-$2,000/month)
- Test channel viability
- Learn mechanics
- Measure basic metrics

**Stage 2: Validation** (Month 4-6)
- Increase budget (2-3x)
- Optimize for efficiency
- Establish CAC baseline
- Prove ROI

**Stage 3: Scaling** (Month 7-12)
- Significant budget increase
- Build processes and systems
- Hire specialists
- Drive meaningful volume

**Stage 4: Optimization** (Ongoing)
- Continuous improvement
- Test variations
- Expand within channel
- Maximize ROI

**Don't Skip Stages!** Many companies scale too fast and burn money.

### 2. The Bullseye Framework (from "Traction")

**Outer Ring**: All possible channels (19 total)
**Middle Ring**: Promising channels (3-5 to test)
**Bullseye**: Your #1 channel (focus here)

**The Process:**
1. **Brainstorm**: List all possible channels
2. **Rank**: Score each on potential
3. **Prioritize**: Pick top 3-5 to test
4. **Test**: Run small experiments
5. **Focus**: Double down on what works

**Common Mistake**: Trying too many channels at once. Pick 1-2 to master first.

### 3. The 19 Traction Channels

We'll cover the most relevant for B2B SaaS:

**1. Content Marketing**
**2. Search Engine Marketing (SEM/PPC)**
**3. Social & Display Ads**
**4. Sales (Outbound)**
**5. SEO**
**6. Partnerships** (covered in previous chapter)
**7. Community Building**
**8. Events & Trade Shows**
**9. Email Marketing**
**10. PR & Media**
**11. Viral/Referral Programs**
**12. Account-Based Marketing (ABM)**

Others (less common for B2B SaaS):
- Offline ads
- Affiliate marketing
- Existing platforms
- Business development
- Engineering as marketing
- Unconventional PR

### 4. Channel-Product Fit

Not all channels work for all products.

**Questions to Ask:**
- Where does our target customer spend time?
- What's our price point? (High = outbound sales, Low = self-serve)
- How complex is our sale? (Complex = content + sales, Simple = ads)
- What's our LTV? (High LTV = higher CAC acceptable)
- How urgent is the need? (High urgency = search ads work well)

**Example: CoodLoom (Restaurant POS)**
- **Good Channels**: Outbound sales, trade shows, content, partnerships
- **Maybe Channels**: Google Ads, SEO, email, events
- **Poor Channels**: Facebook/Instagram ads, PR, viral

**Why?**
- Restaurants aren't urgently searching for POS online
- Decision is considered, not impulsive
- High LTV supports outbound sales
- Trust matters (trade shows, content, referrals work)

## Common Marketing Mistakes

### 1. Trying Too Many Channels
**Mistake**: Spreading budget across 10 channels
**Problem**: Nothing gets enough attention to work
**Solution**: Focus on 2-3 channels, master them

### 2. Scaling Before Validation
**Mistake**: Throwing $50K at Google Ads immediately
**Problem**: Burning money on unoptimized campaigns
**Solution**: Test with small budget, optimize, then scale

### 3. Ignoring CAC
**Mistake**: Celebrating customer wins without knowing cost
**Problem**: Unsustainable growth, running out of money
**Solution**: Track CAC religiously, compare to LTV

### 4. Short-Term Thinking
**Mistake**: Expecting immediate results from SEO or content
**Problem**: Killing channels too early
**Solution**: Match expectations to channel (SEO = 6-12 months)

### 5. No Attribution
**Mistake**: Not tracking where customers come from
**Problem**: Can't optimize, don't know what works
**Solution**: Implement attribution from day one

### 6. Set and Forget
**Mistake**: Launching campaigns and not optimizing
**Problem**: Declining performance over time
**Solution**: Weekly optimization, monthly reviews

### 7. Neglecting Existing Customers
**Mistake**: All budget on acquisition, none on retention
**Problem**: Leaky bucket - can't grow if churning
**Solution**: Balance acquisition with customer marketing
