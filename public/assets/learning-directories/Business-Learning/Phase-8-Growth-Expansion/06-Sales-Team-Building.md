# Sales Team Building

## Introduction
You can't scale a SaaS company on founder-led sales forever. At some point, you need to build a sales team that can replicate your success. This chapter covers how to hire, train, and manage a high-performing sales organization that drives predictable revenue growth.

## Key Concepts

### 1. The Sales Hiring Journey

**Stage 1: Founder-Led Sales** (0-10 customers)
- Founders do all selling
- Learn what works
- Understand customer objections
- Validate pricing
- **Don't hire yet!**

**Stage 2: First Sales Hire** (10-30 customers)
- Hire one sales rep
- Train intensively
- Work alongside them
- Document process
- Prove it's repeatable

**Stage 3: Small Team** (30-100 customers)
- Hire 2-5 reps
- Designate sales manager (maybe you)
- Create playbooks
- Establish metrics
- Build sales operations

**Stage 4: Scaled Team** (100+ customers)
- Dedicated sales leader (VP Sales)
- Multiple teams (SDRs, AEs, CSMs)
- Specialized roles
- Formal training program
- Sales ops team

**Common Mistake**: Hiring too early. Wait until you have 10+ customers from founder-led sales.

### 2. Sales Team Structure

**For B2B SaaS:**

**Small Team (1-5 people):**
```
CEO (closes deals)
├── Sales Rep 1 (full-cycle: prospect to close)
├── Sales Rep 2 (full-cycle: prospect to close)
└── Sales Rep 3 (full-cycle: prospect to close)
```

**Medium Team (5-15 people):**
```
VP Sales
├── SDR Team (3-5 people)
│   ├── SDR Manager
│   └── SDRs (prospecting, qualifying)
├── AE Team (3-5 people)
│   ├── AE Manager
│   └── Account Executives (demos, closing)
└── Sales Ops (1 person)
    └── CRM, reporting, tools
```

**Large Team (15+ people):**
```
CRO (Chief Revenue Officer)
├── VP Sales Development
│   └── SDR Teams (by region/segment)
├── VP Sales
│   └── AE Teams (by region/segment)
├── VP Customer Success
│   └── CSM Teams
└── VP Sales Operations
    └── Ops, enablement, analytics
```

### 3. Sales Roles Defined

## Hiring Your First Sales Rep

### When to Hire

**Ready to Hire When:**
- ✓ 10+ customers from founder-led sales
- ✓ Repeatable sales process documented
- ✓ Product is stable (not constantly breaking)
- ✓ Clear ideal customer profile
- ✓ Customer success process exists
- ✓ Can afford 6-12 months to ramp
- ✓ You have time to train them

**Not Ready When:**
- ✗ No consistent founder-led sales
- ✗ Product still finding PMF
- ✗ High churn (>5% monthly)
- ✗ No sales process documented
- ✗ Can't afford 6-month ramp time

### Ideal First Sales Rep Profile

**Background:**
- 2-5 years B2B sales experience
- SaaS experience preferred (but not required)
- Sold to similar customer (restaurant industry for CoodLoom)
- Hungry and coachable
- Track record of quota achievement

**Skills:**
- ✓ Self-starter (you can't babysit)
- ✓ Organized (manages own pipeline)
- ✓ Curious (asks good questions)
- ✓ Resilient (handles rejection)
- ✓ Consultative (not pushy)
- ✓ Tech-savvy (learns software quickly)

**Red Flags:**
- ✗ Too senior (VP wanting AE role)
- ✗ Job hopper (3+ jobs in 2 years)
- ✗ Blames others for failures
- ✗ Can't explain their sales process
- ✗ Needs extensive hand-holding
- ✗ Arrogant or pushy

### Interview Process

**Stage 1: Phone Screen (30 min)**
- Recruiter or founder
- Basic qualification
- Understand background
- Gauge interest
- Screen out obviously wrong fits

**Stage 2: Video Interview (60 min)**
- Hiring manager (probably you)
- Deeper dive on experience
- Sales methodology questions
- Situational questions
- Culture fit assessment

**Sample Questions:**
- "Walk me through your current sales process, start to finish."
- "Tell me about your best deal. What made it successful?"
- "Tell me about a deal you lost. What happened?"
- "How do you handle objections about price?"
- "How do you prioritize your time?"
- "What motivates you?"

**Stage 3: Role Play (45 min)**
- Have them sell you something
- Give them your product to demo
- See how they think on feet
- Assess communication skills
- Check for coachability

**Scenarios:**
- "Sell me this pen"
- "Demo our POS to me (I'm a restaurant owner)"
- "Handle this objection: 'Too expensive'"

**Stage 4: Reference Checks**
- Call 2-3 references
- Ask about quota attainment
- Ask about strengths/weaknesses
- Verify claims from interviews

**Stage 5: Offer**
- Clear comp structure
- Expectations and quotas
- Onboarding plan
- Start date

**Total Timeline**: 2-3 weeks

### Compensation Structure

**Base + Variable Model:**

**For CoodLoom AE (Full-Cycle Rep):**
- **Base**: $60,000/year
- **Variable**: $60,000/year (on-target earnings = OTE)
- **Total OTE**: $120,000/year
- **Quota**: $600,000 ARR/year
- **Commission**: 10% of ARR (first year revenue)

**Ramp Period:**
- Month 1-3: No quota (learning)
- Month 4-6: 50% quota
- Month 7-9: 75% quota
- Month 10+: 100% quota

**Accelerators:**
- 100-110% of quota: 1x commission rate
- 110-125% of quota: 1.25x commission rate
- 125%+ of quota: 1.5x commission rate

**Example Earnings:**
- 100% quota ($600K sold): $60K base + $60K variable = $120K
- 120% quota ($720K sold): $60K base + $72K variable = $132K
- 150% quota ($900K sold): $60K base + $105K variable = $165K

## Common Sales Mistakes

### 1. Hiring Too Senior Too Early
**Mistake**: Hiring VP Sales as first sales hire
**Problem**: Too expensive, wants to manage not sell
**Solution**: Hire IC (individual contributor) first

### 2. No Onboarding Plan
**Mistake**: Throwing rep into calls immediately
**Problem**: Rep fails, wastes time, costs money
**Solution**: 30-60-90 day onboarding plan

### 3. Unrealistic Quotas
**Mistake**: Setting quota at $1M when no rep has done $500K
**Problem**: Demotivated team, high turnover
**Solution**: Base quotas on actual performance data

### 4. Not Firing Fast Enough
**Mistake**: Keeping underperformers for 6+ months
**Problem**: Costs money, hurts team morale
**Solution**: PIP within 3 months, decision by 6 months

### 5. Neglecting Training
**Mistake**: Train once, then let reps figure it out
**Problem**: Inconsistent results, skill gaps persist
**Solution**: Ongoing weekly training and coaching

### 6. Poor CRM Hygiene
**Mistake**: Not enforcing CRM usage
**Problem**: Can't forecast, lost opportunities
**Solution**: Make CRM mandatory, part of performance review

### 7. Comp Plan Too Complex
**Mistake**: 10-page compensation plans
**Problem**: Reps don't understand, gaming the system
**Solution**: Simple, clear comp plans (1 page)
