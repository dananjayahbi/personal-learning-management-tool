## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Financial Modeling
❌ Building overly complex models (100+ tabs)  
✅ Start simple, add complexity as needed  

❌ Unrealistic growth assumptions (10x in year 1)  
✅ Conservative estimates, beat your plan  

❌ Forgetting to include all costs (taxes, insurance)  
✅ Use the checklist in templates  

### Cash Flow
❌ Not forecasting cash flow separately from P&L  
✅ Maintain 13-week rolling cash forecast  

❌ Ignoring timing of payments  
✅ Track when money actually moves  

### Pricing
❌ Pricing too low (undervaluing your product)  
✅ Price based on value, not cost  

❌ Not testing different price points  
✅ A/B test pricing with new customers  

### Budgeting
❌ Set-and-forget budgets  
✅ Monthly reviews, quarterly updates  

❌ No contingency buffer  
✅ Include 10-15% buffer for unexpected  

### Metrics
❌ Tracking vanity metrics (total users)  
✅ Focus on revenue, retention, unit economics  

❌ Not tracking cohorts  
✅ Cohort analysis shows true retention

**Remember**: These templates are tools, not requirements. Use what helps, skip what doesn't. The goal is understanding your business financially, not perfect spreadsheets. Start simple and add complexity only as needed.

**Pro Tip**: Set aside 2-3 hours every month-end for financial review. Make it a ritual. The discipline of monthly financial analysis will teach you more about your business than any course or book.
