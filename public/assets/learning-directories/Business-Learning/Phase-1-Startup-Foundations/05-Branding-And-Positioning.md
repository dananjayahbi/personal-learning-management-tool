# Branding & Positioning

## Introduction

You have a working product, paying customers, and growing traction. But CoodLoom is still just a name. This chapter transforms CoodLoom from a product into a brand—something customers recognize, trust, and advocate for.

**What You'll Learn**:
- Brand strategy and positioning
- Visual identity (logo, colors, design)
- Voice and messaging
- Domain and online presence
- Building brand equity
- Standing out in a crowded market

## Understanding Brand vs. Product

### The Difference

**Product**: What you sell
- Features, functionality, price
- What it does
- Tangible

**Brand**: What people feel about what you sell
- Perception, trust, emotion
- What it means
- Intangible

**Examples**:
- **Apple**: Product = computers. Brand = innovation, simplicity, premium
- **Square**: Product = payment processing. Brand = empowering small business
- **Toast**: Product = restaurant POS. Brand = restaurant success partner

**Your Product**: CoodLoom POS system
**Your Brand**: [To be defined in this chapter]

### Why Brand Matters

**Without a Brand**:
- Compete solely on price/features
- No customer loyalty
- Hard to differentiate
- Every sale is a battle

**With a Strong Brand**:
- Command premium pricing
- Customer loyalty and advocacy
- Word-of-mouth growth
- Easier sales (trust is pre-built)

**Real Example**:
- Generic POS: "We're 10% cheaper!"
- Strong Brand POS: "We help restaurants thrive."

**Which would you rather be?**

## Brand Strategy Framework

### Step 1: Define Your Brand Purpose

**Why does CoodLoom exist?** (Beyond making money)

**Framework Questions**:
1. What problem are you obsessed with solving?
2. What change do you want to make in the world?
3. Why should anyone care that CoodLoom exists?
4. What would be lost if CoodLoom disappeared tomorrow?

**Examples from Successful Companies**:

**Stripe**: "Increase the GDP of the internet"
- Not: "We process payments"
- But: "We enable online business"

**Shopify**: "Make commerce better for everyone"
- Not: "We sell ecommerce software"
- But: "We democratize entrepreneurship"

**Airbnb**: "Belong anywhere"
- Not: "We rent rooms"
- But: "We create connection"

**Your CoodLoom Purpose** (Draft):
```
CoodLoom exists to ___________________________________
[Hint: Think bigger than "provide POS software"]

Example possibilities:
- "Empower independent businesses to compete with chains"
- "Make running a small business less stressful"
- "Help local businesses thrive in a digital world"
- "Eliminate the pain of outdated technology"
```

**Your Purpose Statement**:
________________________________

### Step 2: Define Your Target Customer (Positioning)

**Who do you serve?** (Be specific!)

**Too Broad**: "Businesses that need a POS"
- Everyone = No one
- Generic messaging
- Hard to win

**Just Right**: "Independent restaurants with 1-3 locations struggling with outdated POS systems"
- Clear target
- Specific messaging
- Easier to dominate niche

**Your Target Customer**:

**Demographics**:
- Industry: ________________________________
- Size: ________________________________
- Location: ________________________________
- Revenue: ________________________________

**Psychographics**:
- Values: ________________________________
- Frustrations: ________________________________
- Aspirations: ________________________________
- Tech comfort: ________________________________

**Their Story** (Craft a narrative):
```
[Name] owns a [business type] in [location]. They've been using
[old solution] for years and are frustrated by [specific problems].
They dream of [aspiration] but [obstacle] is holding them back.
They're looking for [what you provide].
```

**Example**:
```
Maria owns a family restaurant in Austin. She's been using an old
cash register system for 8 years and is frustrated by how long
checkout takes and how often there are errors. She dreams of
opening a second location but managing inventory across multiple
sites feels impossible. She's looking for a modern, reliable POS
that's actually built for restaurants like hers.
```

**Your Customer Story**:
________________________________
________________________________
________________________________

### Step 3: Define Your Positioning

**Positioning Statement Template**:
```
For [target customer]
Who [statement of need or opportunity]
CoodLoom is [product category]
That [statement of key benefit]
Unlike [primary competition]
We [statement of primary differentiation]
```

**Example (Toast POS)**:
```
For restaurant owners
Who need an all-in-one management platform
Toast is a restaurant technology platform
That helps restaurants improve operations and grow sales
Unlike generic POS systems
We are built specifically for restaurants with industry-specific features
```

**Your CoodLoom Positioning Statement**:
```
For ________________________________
Who ________________________________
CoodLoom is ________________________________
That ________________________________
Unlike ________________________________
We ________________________________
```

### Step 4: Define Your Brand Attributes

**Pick 3-5 attributes that define CoodLoom**:

**Category Examples**:
- Innovative vs Reliable
- Simple vs Powerful
- Affordable vs Premium
- Friendly vs Professional
- Bold vs Conservative
- Fast vs Thorough
- Local vs Global

**Your Brand Attributes** (Choose 3-5):
1. ________________: Because ________________
2. ________________: Because ________________
3. ________________: Because ________________
4. ________________: Because ________________
5. ________________: Because ________________

**Example**:
1. **Reliable**: Because restaurants can't afford downtime
2. **Simple**: Because owners aren't tech experts
3. **Personal**: Because we're built for independent businesses
4. **Modern**: Because outdated systems are our enemy
5. **Empowering**: Because we enable business growth

**These attributes guide every brand decision**.

### Step 5: Competitive Positioning Map

**Plot yourself vs. competitors on key dimensions**:

**Dimension 1**: Price (Low ←→ High)
**Dimension 2**: Features (Simple ←→ Complex)

```
Complex Features
        ↑
        |    Clover        Toast
        |         
        |
Simple  |---CoodLoom?------- High Price
        |  Square
        |
        |
        ↓
   Low Price
```

**Where do you want to be?**
- Square quadrant: Low price, simple (commoditized)
- Toast quadrant: High price, complex (enterprise)
- Your quadrant: ________________

**Your Differentiation**:
We win by: ________________________________

**Examples**:
- "Mid-market sweet spot: Better than Square, simpler than Toast"
- "Industry-specific: Built for [your niche], not everyone"
- "Service-first: White-glove support others don't offer"
