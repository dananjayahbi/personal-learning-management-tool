## Interview Script

## Tips for Great Interviews

### Do:
✓ **Listen more than you talk** (80/20 rule)
✓ **Ask follow-up questions** ("Tell me more about that")
✓ **Stay curious** ("Why?" "How?" "What happened next?")
✓ **Take detailed notes** (or record with permission)
✓ **Focus on past behavior** (not hypotheticals)
✓ **Dig for specifics** (time, money, frequency)
✓ **Stay neutral** (don't pitch your solution)

### Don't:
✗ **Lead them to answers** ("Don't you think X is frustrating?")
✗ **Pitch your solution** (This is research, not sales)
✗ **Accept generic answers** ("It's fine" → "What specifically is fine?")
✗ **Ignore negative feedback** (This is gold!)
✗ **Rush through** (Let them talk)
✗ **Skip the follow-up** (Note-taking while fresh is crucial)

### Red Flags:
🚩 They're just being nice (compliments without specifics)
🚩 They can't articulate the problem (maybe it's not that painful)
🚩 They won't commit to anything (not a real prospect)
🚩 Price objections with no value discussion (price shopping)

### Green Flags:
✅ They share specific, recent stories
✅ They quantify the problem ($X lost, X hours wasted)
✅ They ask when you're launching
✅ They offer to introduce you to others
✅ They want to be a beta customer
