## Analysis Guide

### Step 1: Calculate PMF Score

```
PMF Score = (# "Very disappointed" responses / Total responses) × 100

Example:
50 responses total
22 said "Very disappointed"
PMF Score = (22 / 50) × 100 = 44%

Result: Strong PMF (>40%)
```

### Step 2: Segment by Response

**"Very Disappointed" Group (Your Champions):**
- Who are they? (Look at customer profiles)
- What do they value most? (Q3 responses)
- Who do they recommend you to? (Q2 responses)
- What features do they use? (Q7 responses)

**Action:** This is your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

**"Somewhat Disappointed" Group (Warm but not hot):**
- Why aren't they "very disappointed"?
- What improvements would move them? (Q4 responses)
- Are they using all features? (Q7 responses)

**Action:** Improve product to convert them to champions

**"Not Disappointed" Group (Wrong fit):**
- Why did they sign up?
- What's missing for them? (Q4, Q5 responses)
- Are they your target market?

**Action:** Either improve for this segment or focus elsewhere

### Step 3: Extract Key Insights

**Value Proposition (from Q3):**

Aggregate responses to find common themes:
- "Saves me 10 hours per week"
- "Caught inventory errors that saved $2,000"
- "Easy to use unlike competitors"

Extract: Your core value in customers' words

**Ideal Customer (from Q2):**

Look for patterns:
- "Small retail stores"
- "Busy restaurant owners"
- "Stores with 5-20 employees"

Extract: Specific target customer description

**Product Improvements (from Q4):**

Count frequency of requests:
- 15 people want "better reporting"
- 12 people want "mobile app"
- 8 people want "QuickBooks integration"

Extract: Prioritized feature roadmap

**Competitive Alternatives (from Q5):**

Understand your competitive set:
- "Would go back to Square" (15 responses)
- "Would use Excel" (8 responses)
- "Nothing else like this" (5 responses)

Extract: Your competitive positioning

## Survey Delivery Best Practices

### Timing

**When to send:**
- After 2-4 weeks of active product usage
- After customer has experienced "aha moment"
- NOT too early (they haven't seen value yet)
- NOT too late (memory fades, bias sets in)

**Frequency:**
- Quarterly for tracking PMF progress
- After major product updates
- When considering pivots

### Delivery Method

**Option 1: In-app survey (Best response rate)**
```
Pop-up or banner in product:
"Quick question: We'd love your feedback!"

```

**Option 2: Email survey**
```

how you feel about it.

Can you answer one quick question? It takes 30 seconds.

[Link to survey]

[Your name]"

Response rate: 15-25%
```

**Option 3: Personal outreach (Highest quality)**
```
Personal email or call:
"I'm personally reaching out to customers to understand their 
experience. Would you be willing to answer a few questions?"

Response rate: 50-70% (but doesn't scale)
```

## Iteration Plan Based on Results

### If PMF Score < 25% (Weak PMF)

**You don't have PMF yet. Major changes needed.**

**Actions:**
1. Deep dive into "why not disappointed" responses
2. Interview 20+ users about their experience
3. Identify if it's:
   - Wrong customer segment
   - Wrong problem to solve
   - Wrong solution to the problem
   - Poor product execution
4. Consider pivot vs persevere
5. Focus 100% on learning, not scaling

### If PMF Score 25-40% (Emerging PMF)

**You're close but not there yet.**

**Actions:**
1. Analyze "very disappointed" customers deeply
2. Who are they? Double down on this segment

5. Iterate product based on feedback
6. Re-survey in 8-12 weeks

### If PMF Score 40-60% (Strong PMF)

**You have PMF! Time to scale.**

**Actions:**
