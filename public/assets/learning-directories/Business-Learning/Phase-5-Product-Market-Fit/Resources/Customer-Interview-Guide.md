## Part 1: Problem Discovery Interview Script

### Pre-Interview Preparation

- [ ] Send calendar invite with Zoom/meeting link
- [ ] Prepare recording setup (with permission)
- [ ] Review any background on interviewee
- [ ] Have note-taking system ready
- [ ] Silence your phone

**Your Mindset:**
- ✅ You're here to learn, not sell
- ✅ They're the expert, you're the student
- ✅ Seek to understand, not convince
- ✅ Embrace negative feedback
- ✅ Listen 80%, talk 20%

### Opening (2 minutes)

```
"Hi [Name], thanks so much for taking the time to chat with me.

I'm researching [problem area] that [customer segment] face. I'm not 
trying to sell you anything today - I'm genuinely just trying to learn 
about your world and understand your challenges.

I have about [timeframe] of questions. Does that still work for you?

And would it be okay if I record this just for my own notes? Only I 
will listen to it.

[Wait for permission]

Great, thank you. Let's get started."
```

### Section 1: Understanding Their World (10 minutes)

**Goal:** Understand their context, role, and day-to-day

**Questions:**

```
1. Tell me about your role at [Company].
   → Listen for: responsibilities, decision-making power, pain points

2. What does a typical day look like for you?
   → Listen for: workflows, tools used, time allocation

3. Walk me through [specific process related to your product area].
   Example for POS: "Walk me through what happens when a customer 
   makes a purchase at your store."
   → Listen for: current process, pain points, workarounds

4. What are the biggest challenges you face in [relevant area]?
   → Listen for: problems they mention, emotional response

5. If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing about [area], 
   what would it be?
   → Listen for: priority problems, dream solutions
```

**Pro tips:**
- Ask open-ended questions (not yes/no)
- Use "Tell me about..." and "Walk me through..."
- Follow interesting threads with "Tell me more about that"
- Stay silent after asking - let them fill the silence

### Section 2: Digging Deeper on Specific Problems (15 minutes)

**Goal:** Understand specific problems deeply

**Once they mention a problem, drill down:**

```
The 5 Whys Technique:

Customer: "Our POS system is too slow"
You: "Tell me more about that. Why is that a problem?"

Customer: "Customers get frustrated waiting"
You: "I see. Why does that matter?"

Customer: "They sometimes abandon their purchase"
You: "Interesting. Why is that significant for you?"

Customer: "We lose about $500/week in abandoned sales"
You: "Got it. Why haven't you fixed this?"

Customer: "We don't know what other options exist that aren't 
expensive and complicated"
```

**More probing questions:**

```
1. Tell me about the last time [problem] happened.
   → Get specific stories, not hypotheticals

2. How often does [problem] occur?
   → Understand frequency and severity

3. What have you tried to solve [problem]?
   → Learn about attempted solutions

4. Why didn't [attempted solution] work?
   → Understand gaps in existing solutions

5. What does [problem] cost you (time, money, stress)?
   → Quantify the pain

6. Who else is affected by [problem]?
   → Understand broader impact

7. On a scale of 1-10, how painful is [problem]?
   → Gauge priority
```

**Red flags to watch for:**
- ❌ "It's a problem but not a big one" (not painful enough)
- ❌ "We've gotten used to it" (not urgent)
- ❌ "Someone else deals with that" (not their problem)
- ❌ Can't give specific examples (might not be real problem)

**Green lights to watch for:**
- ✅ Emotional language ("frustrating," "painful," "hate")
- ✅ Specific stories with details
- ✅ Quantified costs ($X lost, Y hours wasted)
- ✅ Multiple attempted solutions
- ✅ Active searching for better solution

### Section 3: Current Solutions (8 minutes)

**Goal:** Understand competitive landscape and switching barriers

```
1. What are you currently using to solve [problem]?
   → Learn about competitors and substitutes

2. How did you find/choose [current solution]?
   → Understand their buying process

3. What do you like about [current solution]?
   → Learn what not to mess up

4. What do you wish was different about [current solution]?
   → Identify opportunities

5. How much does [current solution] cost you?
   → Understand price sensitivity and budget

6. What would make you switch to something else?
   → Learn switching triggers

7. Have you looked at alternatives? What stopped you from switching?
   → Understand switching barriers and objections
```

**For each alternative mentioned, ask:**
- "Have you tried [Alternative X]? What was that like?"
- "What did you think of [Feature Y] in [Alternative X]?"

### Section 4: Buying Process (5 minutes)

**Goal:** Understand how they make purchasing decisions (B2B crucial)

```
1. Who else would be involved in deciding to buy a new [solution]?
   → Identify decision-makers and influencers

2. Walk me through how you bought your current [solution].
   → Understand buying process step-by-step

3. What's your typical budget process for something like this?
   → Understand financial constraints and timing

4. How long does it usually take from "this is interesting" to 
   "we bought it"?
   → Understand sales cycle

5. What would cause you to say no to a new [solution]?
   → Identify objections and deal-breakers
```

### Section 5: Network & Referrals (3 minutes)

**Goal:** Get more interview contacts

```
1. Who else do you know who faces similar challenges?
   → Build interview pipeline

2. Would you be willing to introduce me to [1-2 people]?
   → Warm introductions are gold

3. Are there communities or forums where [your target customers] 
   hang out?
   → Find customer congregation points
```

### Closing (2 minutes)

```
"This has been incredibly valuable. Thank you so much for your time.

A few final questions:

1. Is there anything I should have asked but didn't?

2. As I continue this research, would you be open to me following 
   up with you?

3. And would you be willing to introduce me to [2-3 other people] 
   who might have similar challenges?

## Common Interview Mistakes

### 1. Talking Too Much
**Problem:** You dominate conversation explaining your idea
**Fix:** 80/20 rule - them 80%, you 20%

### 2. Leading the Witness
**Bad:** "Don't you hate how slow your POS is?"
**Good:** "Walk me through your checkout process"

### 3. Pitching Instead of Learning
**Problem:** Turning interview into sales call
**Fix:** Save pitch for after you've learned and built

### 4. Taking Compliments as Validation
**Problem:** "Cool idea!" = validation ✗
**Reality:** Only commitment (pre-orders, LOIs) = validation ✓

### 5. Asking Hypotheticals
**Bad:** "Would you use a feature that does X?"
**Good:** "Tell me about the last time you needed to do X"

### 6. Interviewing Friends/Family
**Problem:** They'll be nice and lie to you
**Fix:** Interview strangers who'll be brutally honest

### 7. Stopping After 5 Interviews
**Problem:** Not enough to see patterns
**Fix:** Aim for 30-50 problem discovery interviews

### 8. Not Following Interesting Threads
**Problem:** Rigidly sticking to script
**Fix:** Follow interesting tangents with "tell me more"
