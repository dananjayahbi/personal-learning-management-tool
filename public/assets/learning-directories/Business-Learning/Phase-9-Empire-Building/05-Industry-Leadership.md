## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Prioritizing Visibility Over Excellence

**Problem**: Focusing on PR and marketing before product is truly great

**Solution**: Excellence first, visibility second. No amount of marketing fixes a mediocre product.

### Pitfall 2: Trying to Lead Too Early

**Problem**: Attempting thought leadership without credibility or track record

**Solution**: Build credibility first (2-3 years), then lead.

### Pitfall 3: Inconsistent Presence

**Problem**: Occasional blog post, sporadic speaking, no sustained effort

**Solution**: Consistent, long-term commitment. Leadership is built over years, not months.

### Pitfall 4: Alienating Competitors

**Problem**: Trash-talking competitors, burning bridges

**Solution**: Compete with class. Industry is small, relationships matter.

### Pitfall 5: Ignoring Community

**Problem**: All broadcast, no engagement. Talking at people, not with them.

**Solution**: Build two-way relationships. Listen, engage, collaborate.
