## Part 6: Tax Structure & Strategy

### A. Tax Filing Structure

**Select your tax filing approach:**

☐ **Separate Returns**: Each entity files its own tax return
- Pros: Simplicity, clear separation, easier to sell subsidiary
- Cons: More tax returns, can't offset losses between entities
- Best for: Early stage, simple structures, pass-through entities

☐ **Consolidated Returns** (C-Corps only): File single return for parent + subs
- Pros: Offset profits/losses, one tax bill, administrative efficiency
- Cons: Complex, requires 80%+ ownership, irrevocable election for period
- Best for: Mature structures, all C-Corp subsidiaries, cross-subsidization

☐ **Combined/Unitary Returns** (State-specific): Some states require combined filing
- Check your state requirements: _______________________

**Your Selection**: ☐ Separate ☐ Consolidated ☐ Combined

**Consolidated Tax Election (if selected):**
- [ ] Holding company owns 80%+ of each subsidiary's voting stock ✓
- [ ] Holding company owns 80%+ of each subsidiary's value ✓
- [ ] All entities are C-Corporations ✓
- [ ] Form 1122 filed with initial consolidated return
- [ ] Each subsidiary consents to consolidated filing

### B. Tax Optimization Strategies

**Legitimate Tax Planning Strategies:**

| Strategy | Description | Applicable? | Savings Estimate |
|----------|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Management Fees** | Shift income from high-tax sub to lower-tax holding | ☐ Yes ☐ No | $________/year |
| **IP Licensing** | Charge royalties from operating subs to IP-holding entity | ☐ Yes ☐ No | $________/year |
| **State Planning** | Form entities in low/no tax states where possible | ☐ Yes ☐ No | $________/year |
| **Depreciation** | Centralize capital assets, allocate depreciation optimally | ☐ Yes ☐ No | $________/year |
| **R&D Credits** | Ensure R&D sub captures all eligible credits | ☐ Yes ☐ No | $________/year |
| **QSBS Planning** | Structure for Qualified Small Business Stock benefits | ☐ Yes ☐ No | Potential $10M+ exclusion |

**⚠️ Aggressive strategies to AVOID:**
- Transferring income to entities with no substance
- Charging fees that aren't arm's-length
- Creating entities solely for tax avoidance
- Ignoring transfer pricing requirements

**Work with your CPA on all tax strategies.**

### C. State Tax Considerations

**Nexus Analysis (where do you have tax obligations?):**

| State | Physical Presence | Economic Nexus | Required Filings | Estimated Tax |
|-------|------------------|----------------|------------------|---------------|
| __________ | ☐ Office ☐ Employees ☐ Property | ☐ Sales > $______ | ☐ Income ☐ Sales ☐ Franchise | $________/year |
| __________ | ☐ Office ☐ Employees ☐ Property | ☐ Sales > $______ | ☐ Income ☐ Sales ☐ Franchise | $________/year |
| __________ | ☐ Office ☐ Employees ☐ Property | ☐ Sales > $______ | ☐ Income ☐ Sales ☐ Franchise | $________/year |

**State Planning Opportunities:**
- Form holding company in state with no franchise/income tax (e.g., WY, NV)
- Form operating subsidiaries where you have operations (required anyway)
- Consider Delaware for C-Corps planning exits (strong corporate law, Court of Chancery)

---

## Part 7: Ongoing Maintenance

1. **Ignoring Formalities**
   - Not keeping subsidiaries truly separate
   - Commingling funds
   - Not documenting inter-company transactions
   - Not holding required meetings
   - Risk: Piercing corporate veil, losing liability protection

2. **Poor Transfer Pricing**

   - Adding structure too early (before you need it)
   - Excessive layers of entities
   - Risk: Unnecessary cost, complexity, administrative burden

4. **Under-Capitalization**
   - Not funding subsidiaries adequately
   - Subsidiaries always borrowing from holding
   - No true economic substance
   - Risk: Disregarded entity, consolidated entity, liability exposure

5. **Inadequate Professional Guidance**
   - DIY approach without attorney/CPA
   - Using wrong state's laws
   - Not considering tax implications
   - Risk: Costly errors, missed opportunities, legal exposure

### C. When to Update This Structure

**Triggers for structural review:**

☐ **Revenue Milestones**: Reaching $5M, $10M, $25M+ revenue
☐ **New Business Line**: Adding a distinct new business
☐ **Exit Planning**: Preparing for sale or IPO in next 2-3 years
☐ **Risk Management**: New liability exposure (e.g., physical products, high-risk activities)
☐ **Tax Law Changes**: Major federal or state tax law changes
☐ **Ownership Changes**: New partners, investors, or ownership transfers
☐ **Geographic Expansion**: Expanding to new states or countries
☐ **Regulatory Changes**: New compliance requirements in your industry
