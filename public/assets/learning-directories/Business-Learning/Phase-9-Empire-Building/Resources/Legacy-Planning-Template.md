- ✅ The values and principles you modeled
- ✅ The institutions and systems you improved
- ✅ The people you inspired and mentored
- ✅ The problems you solved
- ✅ The love and kindness you shared

### Three Dimensions of Legacy

**1. Business Legacy**: What you built and created
**2. Impact Legacy**: The problems you solved and lives you improved
