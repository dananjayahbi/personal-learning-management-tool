# Exit Preparation Checklist

## Overview

This comprehensive checklist helps you prepare for an eventual exit—whether through IPO, acquisition, or positioning for a lifestyle/generational hold. Even if you're years away from exit, many of these items should be addressed early to maximize optionality and value.

**Use this checklist starting in Year 3-5, review annually, and complete fully 18-24 months before planned exit.**
