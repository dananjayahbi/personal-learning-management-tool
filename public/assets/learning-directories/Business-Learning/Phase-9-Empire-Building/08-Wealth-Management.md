# Wealth Management

## Introduction
Building a successful business empire creates wealth—potentially life-changing, generational wealth. But creating wealth and keeping wealth are two different skills. This chapter covers how to protect, grow, and wisely use the wealth you build through CoodLoom.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Entrepreneurial Wealth is Different

**Why Founder Wealth is Unique:**

**Concentration Risk:**
- Most wealth tied up in one asset (your company)
- Illiquid until exit event
- High risk / high reward
- Need different strategy than W-2 employee

**Volatility:**
- Company value fluctuates wildly
- Can be worth $50M one day, $10M the next
- Private valuations subjective
- Emotional roller coaster

**Tax Complexity:**
- Equity compensation (options, RSUs)
- Capital gains vs ordinary income
- State and federal implications
- International considerations
- Need expert tax planning

**Liquidity Events:**
- Sudden large cash influx (acquisition, IPO)
- Life-changing money arrives at once
- Easy to make mistakes
- Need plan BEFORE liquidity event

**Your Journey:**
- Year 1-5: Mostly illiquid (paper wealth)
- Year 5-10: Some liquidity (secondary sales, dividends)
- Year 10+: Major liquidity (exit or mature distributions)

### 2. Wealth Management Stages

**Stage 1: Building (Year 1-5)**
- Net Worth: $0-500K (mostly company equity)
- Focus: Build the business
- Wealth Strategy: Minimize personal spending, maximize business value
- Tax Strategy: Optimize founder stock structure

**Stage 2: Scaling (Year 5-7)**
- Net Worth: $500K-5M (growing equity value)
- Focus: Scale business, create first liquid wealth
- Wealth Strategy: Start diversification, protect downside
- Tax Strategy: Harvest losses, optimize structure

**Stage 3: Mature (Year 7-10)**
- Net Worth: $5M-50M+ (substantial equity)
- Focus: Prepare for liquidity event
- Wealth Strategy: Comprehensive plan for exit
- Tax Strategy: Minimize exit taxes

**Stage 4: Post-Exit (Year 10+)**
- Net Worth: $10M-500M+ (liquid wealth)
- Focus: Preserve and grow wealth
- Wealth Strategy: Diversification and generational planning
- Tax Strategy: Estate planning, tax-efficient investing

### 3. The Wealth Management Team

**You Can't Do This Alone**

**Your Wealth Team (Build Over Time):**

**Year 1-3:**
- [ ] Good accountant/CPA (business + personal)
- [ ] Business attorney
- [ ] Basic insurance (health, life, disability)

**Year 3-5:**
- [ ] Tax attorney (as wealth grows)
- [ ] Financial advisor (fee-only fiduciary)
- [ ] Estate attorney (will, basic planning)

**Year 5-10:**
- [ ] Wealth advisor (comprehensive planning)
- [ ] Tax strategist (advanced planning)
- [ ] Family office (if $50M+ net worth)

**Cost Expectations:**
- Basic team (Year 1-3): $10-25K/year
- Advanced team (Year 5-7): $50-100K/year
- Comprehensive team (Year 10+): $200-500K/year
- Worth every penny!

## Pre-Exit Wealth Strategies

### Strategy 1: Optimize Founder Stock Structure

**Critical Early Decisions (Year 1)**

**Founder Stock Options:**

**Option A: C-Corp Stock**
- Standard corporate stock
- Capital gains tax on appreciation
- Simple and straightforward

**Option B: 83(b) Election**
- File within 30 days of stock grant
- Pay tax now on $0 value
- All future appreciation = capital gains (not ordinary income)
- **Potential savings**: $millions in taxes!
- **Must do early!**

**Example:**
- Receive 1M shares at $0.01/share = $10K value
- File 83(b), pay tax on $10K now (~$3K tax)
- Company later worth $50/share = $50M value
- Sell: Pay capital gains on $50M - $10K = ~$10M tax (20%)
- Without 83(b): Would pay ordinary income tax (~$17M!)
- **Savings: $7M!**

**Action Item**: Talk to tax attorney in first 30 days!

**Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS)**

**Section 1202 Tax Break:**
- Must be C-Corp
- Must be qualified business (most tech companies qualify)
- Must hold stock >5 years
- Must be issued at founding
- **Benefit**: Exclude up to $10M or 10x basis (whichever is greater) from capital gains tax

**Example:**
- Invest $100K in founding
- Company acquired for $20M (your stake)
- Normal capital gains tax: $4M (20% of $20M)
- With QSBS: Tax only on $10M = $2M tax
- **Savings: $2M!**

**Action Item**: Set up properly from day one with tax attorney!

### Strategy 2: Diversification Through Secondary Sales

**Once Company Valuable (Year 5+)**

**Secondary Sale Options:**

**1. Secondary Market Sale**
- Sell some shares to investors
- Before IPO or acquisition
- Get liquidity while staying involved
- Typical: Sell 10-30% of holdings

**When Available:**
- Late-stage funding rounds
- Tender offers by buyers
- Secondary marketplaces (Forge, EquityZen)

**Example:**
- Own 40% of company worth $50M = $20M paper wealth
- Sell 10% stake ($2M) to investor
- Get liquid money now
- Still own 36% ($18M) for upside

**Benefits:**
- Reduce concentration risk
- Take some chips off table
- Buy house, diversify investments
- Sleep better at night

**2. Early Exercise Programs**
- Exercise stock options early
- Start capital gains clock
- Pay exercise cost now
- Tax benefit later

**3. Dividend Recaps (Advanced)**
- Company takes on debt
- Pays special dividend to shareholders
- You get cash, keep equity
- Common in private equity deals

### Strategy 3: Personal Financial Foundation

**Boring But Critical**

**Emergency Fund:**
- 6-12 months personal expenses
- Liquid and accessible
- High-yield savings account
- Don't touch it!

**Appropriate Insurance:**

**Life Insurance:**
- Term life (20-30 year term)
- Amount: 10-20x annual expenses
- Protect family if something happens
- Cost: $1-3K/year

**Disability Insurance:**
- Replace income if you can't work
- Critical for entrepreneurs (no employer coverage)
- Get before any health issues
- Cost: $2-5K/year

**Umbrella Liability:**
- $2-5M coverage
- Protects personal assets
- Defense against lawsuits
- Cost: $500-1K/year

**Property & Casualty:**
- Home, auto, valuables
- Adequate coverage limits
- Review annually

**Personal Accounting:**
- Track personal net worth
- Separate business and personal
- Budget and spending plan
- Financial dashboard

### Strategy 4: Tax Optimization

**Tax is Your Biggest Expense**

**Key Strategies:**

**1. Defer Income When Possible**
- Defer salary/bonuses to lower-income years
- Time liquidity events strategically
- Use retirement accounts (max out!)
- Stock options timing

**2. Maximize Deductions**
- Home office (if legitimate)
- Business expenses (careful here!)
- Charitable giving
- Retirement contributions

**3. Optimize Entity Structure**
- C-Corp vs LLC vs S-Corp
- Holding company structure
- State tax considerations
- International planning (if applicable)

**4. Capital Gains vs Ordinary Income**
- Long-term capital gains = 20% (vs 37% ordinary)
- Hold assets >1 year when possible
- Stock options vs RSUs
- Qualified dividends

**5. State Tax Planning**
- Consider residency (some states have no income tax)
- Timing of liquidity events
- Multi-state businesses
- Be careful (can't fake residency!)

**6. Charitable Giving (Tax-Efficient)**
- Donate appreciated stock (not cash)
- Avoid capital gains, get deduction
- Donor-advised funds
- Private foundation (if >$10M)

## Post-Exit Wealth Strategies

### Managing Sudden Wealth

**You Just Got $20M-100M+ Liquidity Event**

**First 90 Days: DO NOT MAKE BIG DECISIONS**

**The Windfall Mistake:**
- Buy mansion, yacht, supercar
- Invest in friend's startup
- Make emotional decisions
- Lose substantial wealth fast

**Do This Instead:**

**Week 1-4: Secure and Protect**
- Wire funds to FDIC-insured accounts ($250K per bank)
- Use multiple banks if needed
- Set up simple investment (money market fund)
- Tell almost no one about windfall

**Week 4-8: Assemble Team**
- Interview 3-5 wealth advisors
- Interview 2-3 tax attorneys
- Interview 2-3 estate planners
- Check references and credentials

**Week 8-12: Create Plan**
- Comprehensive financial plan
- Tax optimization strategy
- Estate plan
- Charitable giving plan
- Spending policy

**Month 4-6: Begin Implementation**
- Investment allocation
- Tax strategies executed
- Estate documents signed
- Charitable foundation (if desired)

**Month 6-12: Settle into New Normal**
- Monitor and adjust
- Establish routines
- Enjoy responsibly
- Plan for future

### Investment Strategy

**Asset Allocation for Entrepreneurs**

**The Problem:**
- Most wealth was in one asset (your company)
- Now liquid, need to diversify
- Different from typical investor

**Recommended Allocation (Post-Exit):**

**Conservative (For $10-30M Net Worth):**
- 40% stocks (diversified index funds)
- 40% bonds (high-quality, short-term)
- 10% real estate (REITs or direct)
- 5% alternatives (private equity, hedge funds)
- 5% cash (emergency fund)

**Moderate (For $30-100M Net Worth):**
- 50% stocks (more diversification)
- 30% bonds
- 10% real estate
- 5% alternatives
- 5% cash

**Aggressive (For $100M+ Net Worth):**
- 60% stocks (including international)
- 20% bonds
- 10% real estate
- 8% alternatives (venture, private equity)
- 2% cash

**Key Principles:**

**1. Diversification**
- Never concentrate again (learned that lesson!)
- Across asset classes
- Across geographies
- Across strategies

**2. Low Fees**
- Index funds (0.05% fees)
- Avoid active managers charging 1-2%
- Fees compound against you
- Every 1% in fees = 25% less wealth over 30 years

**3. Tax Efficiency**
- Municipal bonds (tax-free)
- Index funds (low turnover)
- Tax-loss harvesting
- Asset location (right accounts)

**4. Long-Term Focus**
- Buy and hold
- Ignore market noise
- Rebalance annually
- Don't try to time market

**5. Appropriate Risk**
- You already took huge risk (company)
- Preserve wealth, don't need to swing for fences
- 6-8% real returns sufficient
- Sleep at night

### Estate Planning

**Protecting Wealth for Future Generations**

**Basic Estate Documents (Everyone Needs):**

**1. Will**

## Common Wealth Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Lifestyle Inflation

**The Trap:**
- Get wealthy
- Upgrade everything
- Spend aggressively
- Burn through money

**Examples:**
- $20M house (when $2M would do)
- $500K cars (depreciating assets)
- Private jets (cost $2-5M/year to operate)
- Staff and overhead
- "Friends" who need money

**Result**: $50M net worth → Broke in 10 years (sad but common!)

**Solution:**
- "One level down" rule
- If you can afford $20M house, buy $5M
- If you can afford $500K car, buy $100K
- Save the difference
- Future self will thank you

### Mistake 2: Trying to Get Richer

**The Trap:**

- Can't stop chasing more
- Make risky investments
- Friend's startups, get-rich schemes

- Business building ≠ Investing
- Ego and reputation at stake
- FOMO on deals

**Solution:**
- Recognize when "enough is enough"
- Preserve wealth, don't chase returns
- Angel invest for fun (budget <5% of net worth)

### Mistake 3: Trusting the Wrong People

**The Trap:**

**Solution:**
- Fee-only fiduciary advisors

- File extensions if needed
- Plan years in advance

### Mistake 5: No Plan or Goals

**The Trap:**
- Get wealthy
- No plan for money
- Drift and waste
- No fulfillment
- Die with money unspent or wasted

**Questions to Answer:**

**Solution:**
