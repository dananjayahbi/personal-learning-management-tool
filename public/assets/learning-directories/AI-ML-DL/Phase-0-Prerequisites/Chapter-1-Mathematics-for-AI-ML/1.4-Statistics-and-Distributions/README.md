# 1.4 Statistics and Distributions - README

## 📚 Section Overview

Statistics provides tools for understanding data, making inferences, and evaluating models. Every ML project starts with statistical analysis of the data.

## 🎯 Why Statistics Matters in ML

- **EDA**: Understanding data before modeling
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing performance rigorously
- **Feature Engineering**: Finding important variables
- **Experimental Design**: A/B testing and causal inference

## 💡 Key Statistical Concepts

- **68-95-99.7 Rule**: For normal distributions
- **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**: Fundamental ML concept
- **Statistical Significance**: p < 0.05 convention
- **Correlation ≠ Causation**: Critical to remember!
