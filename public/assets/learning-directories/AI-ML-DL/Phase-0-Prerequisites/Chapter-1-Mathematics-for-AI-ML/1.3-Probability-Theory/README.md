## 🎯 Why Probability Matters in ML

- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Models make probabilistic predictions
- **Bayesian Methods**: Prior + Likelihood → Posterior
- **Generative Models**: Learn probability distributions
- **Decision Making**: Optimal decisions under uncertainty

## 💡 Bayes' Theorem

$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}$$

The most important formula in machine learning!
